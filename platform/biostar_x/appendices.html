GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
 
Version 2.1, February 1999
 
Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
 
[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
the version number 2.1.]
 
Preamble
 
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom
to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses
are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
 
This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations
below.
 
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
these things.
 
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
 
For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
 
We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
 
To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there
is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified
by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what
they have is not the original version, so that the original author's
reputation will not be affected by problems that might be introduced
by others.
 
Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
 
Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
libraries into non-free programs.
 
When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a
shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
the library.
 
We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less
of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
special circumstances.
 
For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it
becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must
be allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
 
In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
system.
 
Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
that program using a modified version of the Library.
 
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library". The
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
be combined with the library in order to run.  TERMS AND CONDITIONS
FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
 
0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License"). Each
licensee is addressed as "you".
 
A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
 
The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term "modification".)
 
"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
compilation and installation of the library.
 
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and
what the program that uses the Library does.
 
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.
 
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.
 
2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of
it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute
such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above,
provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
 
   * a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
 
   * b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
 
   * c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
       charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
 
   * d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or
     a table of data to be supplied by an application program that
     uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the
     facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to
     ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such
     function or table, the facility still operates, and performs
     whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.
 
     (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots
     has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
     application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
     application-supplied function or table used by this function
     must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the
     square root function must still compute square roots.)
 
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.
 
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library.
 
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.
 
3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in
these notices.
 
Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that
copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
 
This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the
Library into a program that is not a library.
 
4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative
of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the
terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with
the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be
distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
customarily used for software interchange.
 
If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from
a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source
code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the
source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the
source along with the object code.
 
5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library". Such a work,
in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore
falls outside the scope of this License.
 
However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
library". The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section
6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
 
When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is
not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
 
If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure
layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions
(ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is
unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6.)
 
Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section
6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
 
6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link
a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a work
containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under
terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of
the work for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for
debugging such modifications.
 
You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one
of these things:
 
   * a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
     machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
     changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
     Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable
     linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable
     "work that uses the Library", as object code and/or source code,
     so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to
     produce a modified executable containing the modified
     Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the
     contents of definitions files in the Library will not
     necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the
     modified definitions.)
   *  b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
     Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
     copy of the library already present on the user's computer
     system, rather than copying library functions into the
     executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified
     version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the
     modified version is interface-compatible with the version that
     the work was made with.
   *  c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least
     three years, to give the same user the materials specified in
     Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of
     performing this distribution.
   * d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to
     copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy
     the above specified materials from the same place.
   * e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
     materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
 
For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception,
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.
 
It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
distribute.
 
7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
 
   * a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
     based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
     facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the
     Sections above.
 
   *  b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
     that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
     where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
 
8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the
Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the
Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so
long as such parties remain in full compliance.
 
9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.
 
10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted
herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third
parties with this License.
 
11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
 
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.
 
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices. Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.
 
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.
 
12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
 
13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such
new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
 
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.
 
14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
and reuse of software generally.
 
NO WARRANTY
 
15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS
AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF
ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
 
16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
 
Preamble
========
 
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom
to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.
 
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have
the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
 
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.  These
restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
 
For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you
have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
 
We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.
 
Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.
 
Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent
must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
 
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.
 
                     GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
 0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
    notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
    under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program",
    below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on
    the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under
    copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a
    portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
    translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
    included without limitation in the term "modification".)  Each
    licensee is addressed as "you".
 
    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are
    not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act
    of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the
    Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on
    the Program (independent of having been made by running the
    Program).  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
 
 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
    source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
    conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
    copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
    notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
    warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of
    this License along with the Program.
 
    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
    and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange
    for a fee.
 
 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
    of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
    distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
    above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
 
      a. You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
         stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
 
      b. You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that
         in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program
         or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge
         to all third parties under the terms of this License.
 
      c. If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
         when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
         interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display
         an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and
         a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you
         provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the
         program under these conditions, and telling the user how to
         view a copy of this License.  (Exception: if the Program
         itself is interactive but does not normally print such an
         announcement, your work based on the Program is not required
         to print an announcement.)
 
    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the
    Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate
    works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not
    apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate
    works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a
    whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of
    the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions
    for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each
    and every part regardless of who wrote it.
 
    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or
    contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the
    intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of
    derivative or collective works based on the Program.
 
    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the
    Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on
    a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the
    other work under the scope of this License.
 
 3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms
    of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the
    following:
 
      a. Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
         source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
         Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for
         software interchange; or,
 
      b. Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
         years, to give any third-party, for a charge no more than your
         cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
         machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
         distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
         medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
 
      c. Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
         to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
         allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
         received the program in object code or executable form with
         such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
 
    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
    making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete
    source code means all the source code for all modules it contains,
    plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts
    used to control compilation and installation of the executable.
    However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need
    not include anything that is normally distributed (in either
    source or binary form) with the major components (compiler,
    kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable
    runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.
 
    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
    access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
    access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
    distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
    compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
 
 4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
    except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
    otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
    void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
    License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
    from you under this License will not have their licenses
    terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
 
 5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
    signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify
    or distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions
    are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.
    Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work
    based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this
    License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
    distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.
 
 6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program
    subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any
    further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights
    granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance
    by third parties to this License.
 
 7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent
    issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,
    agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this
    License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this
    License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously
    your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
    obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the
    Program at all.  For example, if a patent license would not permit
    royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
    receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only
    way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain
    entirely from distribution of the Program.
 
    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable
    under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is
    intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply
    in other circumstances.
 
    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of
    any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting
    the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
    implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
    generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
    through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
    system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is
    willing to distribute software through any other system and a
    licensee cannot impose that choice.
 
    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed
    to be a consequence of the rest of this License.
 
 8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,
    the original copyright holder who places the Program under this
    License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation
    excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only
    in or among countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this
    License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of
    this License.
 
 9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
    versions of the General Public License from time to time.  Such
    new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but
    may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
 
    Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
    Program specifies a version number of this License which applies
    to it and "any later version", you have the option of following
    the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later
    version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Program
    does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose
    any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
 
10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
    author to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted
    by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software
    Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our decision
    will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of
    all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
    and reuse of software generally.
 
                               NO WARRANTY
11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
    WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
    LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
    HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT
    WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT
    NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND
    FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE
    QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
    PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY
    SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
 
12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY
    MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE
    LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,
    INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
    INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
    DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU
    OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY
    OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN
    ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 
                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
 
How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
=============================================
 
If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
terms.
 
To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to
attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
 
    ONE LINE TO GIVE THE PROGRAM'S NAME AND A BRIEF IDEA OF WHAT IT DOES.
    Copyright (C) YYYY  NAME OF AUTHOR
 
    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.
 
    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.
 
    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307, USA.
 
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
 
If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:
 
    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19YY NAME OF AUTHOR
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
 
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the
commands you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show
c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your
program.
 
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
 
    Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
    `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.
 
    SIGNATURE OF TY COON, 1 April 1989
    Ty Coon, President of Vice
 
This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library,
you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary
applications with the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the
GNU Library General Public License instead of this License.</pre>

    #  A large portion of the dictionary entries
    #  originate from ICOT Free Software.  The following conditions for ICOT
    #  Free Software applies to the current dictionary as well.
    #
    #  Each User may also freely distribute the Program, whether in its
    #  original form or modified, to any third party or parties, PROVIDED
    #  that the provisions of Section 3 ("NO WARRANTY") will ALWAYS appear
    #  on, or be attached to, the Program, which is distributed substantially

    #  distribution, if actually made, will neither violate or otherwise
    #  contravene any of the laws and regulations of the countries having
    #  jurisdiction over the User or the intended distribution itself.
    #
    #  NO WARRANTY
    #
    #  The program was produced on an experimental basis in the course of the
    #  research and development conducted during the project and is provided
    #  to users as so produced on an experimental basis.  Accordingly, the
    #  program is provided without any warranty whatsoever, whether express,
    #  implied, statutory or otherwise.  The term "warranty" used herein
    #  includes, but is not limited to, any warranty of the quality,
    #  performance, merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose of
    #  the program and the nonexistence of any infringement or violation of
    #  any right of any third party.
    #
    #  Each user of the program will agree and understand, and be deemed to
    #  have agreed and understood, that there is no warranty whatsoever for
    #  the program and, accordingly, the entire risk arising from or
    #  otherwise connected with the program is assumed by the user.
    #
    #  Therefore, neither ICOT, the copyright holder, or any other
    #  organization that participated in or was otherwise related to the
    #  development of the program and their respective officials, directors,
    #  officers and other employees shall be held liable for any and all
    #  damages, including, without limitation, general, special, incidental
    #  and consequential damages, arising out of or otherwise in connection
    #  with the use or inability to use the program or any product, material
    #  or result produced or otherwise obtained by using the program,
    #  regardless of whether they have been advised of, or otherwise had
    #  knowledge of, the possibility of such damages at any time during the
    #  project or thereafter.  Each user will be deemed to have agreed to the
    #  foregoing by his or her commencement of use of the program.  The term
    #  "use" as used herein includes, but is not limited to, the use,
    #  modification, copying and distribution of the program and the
    #  production of secondary products from the program.
    #
    #  In the case where the program, whether in its original form or
    #  modified, was distributed or delivered to or received by a user from
    #  any person, organization or entity other than ICOT, unless it makes or
    #  grants independently of ICOT any specific warranty to the user in
    #  writing, such person, organization or entity, will also be exempted
    #  from and not be held liable to the user for any such damages as noted
    #  above as far as the program is concerned.

   5. Time Zone Database
 
     ICU uses the public domain data and code derived from Time Zone
   Database for its time zone support. The ownership of the TZ database
   is explained in BCP 175: Procedure for Maintaining the Time Zone
   Database section 7.
 
    # 7.  Database Ownership
    #
    #    The TZ database itself is not an IETF Contribution or an IETF
    #    document.  Rather it is a pre-existing and regularly updated work
    #    that is in the public domain, and is intended to remain in the
    #    public domain.  Therefore, BCPs 78 [RFC5378] and 79 [RFC3979] do
    #    not apply to the TZ Database or contributions that individuals make
    #    to it.  Should any claims be made and substantiated against the TZ
    #    Database, the organization that is providing the IANA
    #    Considerations defined in this RFC, under the memorandum of
    #    understanding with the IETF, currently ICANN, may act in accordance
    #    with all competent court orders.  No ownership claims will be made
    #    by ICANN or the IETF Trust on the database or the code.  Any person
    #    making a contribution to the database or code waives all rights to
    #    future claims in that contribution or in the TZ Database.

   Package available as open source and free software.
 
   You are always permitted to make arrangements wholly outside of this
   license directly with the Copyright Holder of a given Package.  If the
   terms of this license do not permit the full use that you propose to
   make of the Package, you should contact the Copyright Holder and seek
   a different licensing arrangement.
 
   Definitions
 
       "Copyright Holder" means the individual(s) or organization(s)
       named in the copyright notice for the entire Package.
 
       "Contributor" means any party that has contributed code or other
       material to the Package, in accordance with the Copyright Holder's
       procedures.
 
       "You" and "your" means any person who would like to copy,
       distribute, or modify the Package.
 
       "Package" means the collection of files distributed by the
       Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection and/or of
       those files. A given Package may consist of either the Standard
       Version, or a Modified Version.
 
       "Distribute" means providing a copy of the Package or making it
       accessible to anyone else, or in the case of a company or
       organization, to others outside of your company or organization.
 
       "Distributor Fee" means any fee that you charge for Distributing
       this Package or providing support for this Package to another
       party.  It does not mean licensing fees.
 
       "Standard Version" refers to the Package if it has not been
       modified, or has been modified only in ways explicitly requested
       by the Copyright Holder.
 
       "Modified Version" means the Package, if it has been changed, and
       such changes were not explicitly requested by the Copyright
       Holder.
 
       "Original License" means this Artistic License as Distributed with
       the Standard Version of the Package, in its current version or as
       it may be modified by The Perl Foundation in the future.
 
       "Source" form means the source code, documentation source, and
       configuration files for the Package.
 
       "Compiled" form means the compiled bytecode, object code, binary,
       or any other form resulting from mechanical transformation or
       translation of the Source form.
 
   Permission for Use and Modification Without Distribution
 
   (1)  You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use
   Modified Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that
   you do not Distribute the Modified Version.
 
   Permissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version
 
   (2)  You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the
   Standard Version of this Package in any medium without restriction,
   either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, provided that you duplicate
   all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.  At
   your discretion, such verbatim copies may or may not include a
   Compiled form of the Package.
 
   (3)  You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other
   modifications made available from the Copyright Holder.  The resulting
   Package will still be considered the Standard Version, and as such
   will be subject to the Original License.
 
   Distribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source
 
   (4)  You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis
   or for a Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the
   Modified Version) provided that you clearly document how it differs
   from the Standard Version, including, but not limited to, documenting
   any non-standard features, executables, or modules, and provided that
   you do at least ONE of the following:
 
       (a)  make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder
       of the Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the
       Copyright Holder may include your modifications in the Standard
       Version.
 
       (b)  ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not
       prevent the user installing or running the Standard Version. In
       addition, the Modified Version must bear a name that is different
       from the name of the Standard Version.
 
       (c)  allow anyone who receives a copy of the Modified Version to
       make the Source form of the Modified Version available to others
       under
 
           (i)  the Original License or
 
           (ii)  a license that permits the licensee to freely copy,
           modify and redistribute the Modified Version using the same
           licensing terms that apply to the copy that the licensee
           received, and requires that the Source form of the Modified
           Version, and of any works derived from it, be made freely
           available in that license fees are prohibited but Distributor
           Fees are allowed.
 
   Distribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version
   or Modified Versions without the Source
 
   (5)  You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without
   the Source, provided that you include complete instructions on how to
   get the Source of the Standard Version.  Such instructions must be
   valid at the time of your distribution.  If these instructions, at any
   time while you are carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you
   must provide new instructions on demand or cease further distribution.
   If you provide valid instructions or cease distribution within thirty
   days after you become aware that the instructions are invalid, then
   you do not forfeit any of your rights under this license.
 
   (6)  You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without
   the Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to
   the Source of the Modified Version.
 
   Aggregating or Linking the Package
 
   (7)  You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or
   Modified Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting
   aggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the
   Package.  Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other
   components in the aggregation are permitted. The terms of this license
   apply to the use and Distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions
   as included in the aggregation.
 
   (8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with
   other works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to
   build stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of applications that
   include the Package, and Distribute the result without restriction,
   provided the result does not expose a direct interface to the Package.
 
   Items That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version
 
   (9) Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that
   merely extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause
   the Package to be a Modified Version.  In addition, such works are not
   considered parts of the Package itself, and are not subject to the
   terms of this license.
 
   General Provisions
 
   (10)  Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or
   Modified Versions is governed by this Artistic License. By using,
   modifying or distributing the Package, you accept this license. Do not
   use, modify, or distribute the Package, if you do not accept this
   license.
 
   (11)  If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified
   Version made by someone other than you, you are nevertheless required
   to ensure that your Modified Version complies with the requirements of
   this license.
 
   (12)  This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark,
   service mark, tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder.
 
   (13)  This license includes the non-exclusive, worldwide,
   free-of-charge patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell,
   sell, import and otherwise transfer the Package with respect to any
   patent claims licensable by the Copyright Holder that are necessarily
   infringed by the Package. If you institute patent litigation
   (including a cross-claim or counterclaim) against any party alleging
   that the Package constitutes direct or contributory patent
   infringement, then this Artistic License to you shall terminate on the
   date that such litigation is filed.
 
   (14)  Disclaimer of Warranty:
   THE PACKAGE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER AND CONTRIBUTORS "AS
   IS' AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES. THE IMPLIED
   WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR
   NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE DISCLAIMED TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY YOUR LOCAL
   LAW. UNLESS REQUIRED BY LAW, NO COPYRIGHT HOLDER OR CONTRIBUTOR WILL
   BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL
   DAMAGES ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THE PACKAGE, EVEN IF
   ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.

GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 3, 29 June 2007
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.
0. Additional Definitions.
As used herein, “this License” refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public License, and the “GNU GPL” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
“The Library” refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.
An “Application” is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface provided by the Library.
A “Combined Work” is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with the Library. The particular version of the Library with which the Combined Work was made is also called the “Linked Version”.
The “Minimal Corresponding Source” for a Combined Work means the Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.
The “Corresponding Application Code” for a Combined Work means the object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.
1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.
You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.
2. Conveying Modified Versions.
If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified version:
a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or
b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License applicable to that copy.
3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.
The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:
a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.
b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.
4. Combined Works.
You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of the following:
a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.
b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.
c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.
d) Do one of the following:
0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.
1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked Version.
e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is necessary to install and execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)
5. Combined Libraries.
You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by side in a single library together with other library facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:
a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the terms of this License.
b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that published version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.</pre>

This package contains C software to implement JPEG image encoding, decoding,and transcoding.  JPEG is a standardized compression method for full-color and gray-scale images.
The distributed programs provide conversion between JPEG "JFIF" format and image files in PBMPLUS PPM/PGM, GIF, BMP, and Targa file formats.
The core compression and decompression library can easily be reused in other programs, such as image viewers.  The package is highly portable C code;
we have tested it on many machines ranging from PCs to Crays.
We are releasing this software for both noncommercial and commercial use.
Companies are welcome to use it as the basis for JPEG-related products.
We do not ask a royalty, although we do ask for an acknowledgement in product literature (see the README file in the distribution for details).
We hope to make this software industrial-quality --- although, as with anything that's free, we offer no warranty and accept no liability.

GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 3, 29 June 2007
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.
0. Additional Definitions.
As used herein, “this License” refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public License, and the “GNU GPL” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
“The Library” refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.
An “Application” is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface provided by the Library.
A “Combined Work” is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with the Library. The particular version of the Library with which the Combined Work was made is also called the “Linked Version”.
The “Minimal Corresponding Source” for a Combined Work means the Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.
The “Corresponding Application Code” for a Combined Work means the object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.
1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.
You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.
2. Conveying Modified Versions.
If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified version:
a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or
b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License applicable to that copy.
3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.
The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:
a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.
b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.
4. Combined Works.
You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of the following:
a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.
b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.
c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.
d) Do one of the following:
0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.
1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked Version.
e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is necessary to install and execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)
5. Combined Libraries.
You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by side in a single library together with other library facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:
a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the terms of this License.
b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that published version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.</pre>

PCRE LICENSE
PCRE is a library of functions to support regular expressions whose syntax
and semantics are as close as possible to those of the Perl 5 language.
 
Release 8 of PCRE is distributed under the terms of the "BSD" licence, as
specified below. The documentation for PCRE, supplied in the "doc"
directory, is distributed under the same terms as the software itself.
 
The basic library functions are written in C and are freestanding. Also
included in the distribution is a set of C++ wrapper functions, and a
just-in-time compiler that can be used to optimize pattern matching. These
are both optional features that can be omitted when the library is built.

where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
as of the date such litigation is filed.
 
4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the

of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
as modifying the License.
 
You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
the conditions stated in this License.
 
5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
 
6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade

whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
 
9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

LGPL 2.1
Most Hibernate projects are released under LGPL v2.1.
 
The maintainers of Hibernate have consistently understood the LGPL to simply allow Hibernate to be used by both open source and proprietary code without any impact on the licensing or distribution of such independent code. This interpretation applies regardless of whether a binary that includes Hibernate code is designed to run on the JVM or is a native image generated through use of tools and frameworks like GraalVM and Quarkus.
 
More detailed explanation
The original version of the LGPL was written in 1991 with embedded C programming in mind, before Java existed. This has sometimes led to questions about how to interpret LGPL in a Java context. The “L” in LGPL originally stood for “library”; LGPL was designed to enable libraries to be used by proprietary applications in situations that might be impermissible under the ordinary GPL. For this reason, the LGPL is classified as a “weak copyleft” license, in contrast to the GPL which is considered a “strong copyleft”. The “L” in LGPL was later reinterpreted to mean “lesser”, to communicate the fact that it has more limited scope than the GPL and is not meant exclusively for libraries.
 
By the 2000s, the LGPL had become one of the most widely used and best known open source licenses. At this time, some Java developers naturally began to adopt the LGPL for their projects as a more permissive and flexible alternative to the GPL. For projects like Hibernate, the LGPL had a simple interpretation in the Java setting, which can be summarized as follows:
 
LGPL requirements are triggered only if there is distribution; internal use is not restricted.
 
Distributors of binaries built from LGPL-licensed source code must comply with the LGPL by providing source code corresponding only to the LGPL-covered parts of the binary.
 
There is no requirement to publish independent code that, for example, merely imports LGPL-covered packages or classes. Such independent code can be under different licensing terms, including proprietary licensing terms or other open source licenses.
 
Modifications of LGPL-licensed source code, if distributed, must be licensed under the LGPL.
 
This has been the consistent interpretation of the LGPL by the maintainers of Hibernate ever since the project adopted LGPL.
 
Use in GraalVM native images
Recently there has been interest in native compilation for Java using tools like GraalVM, such as commonly used in frameworks like Quarkus. The view of the Hibernate maintainers is that native compilation is a technical detail that does not fundamentally change how LGPL works for Java code. In a native image that includes LGPL-licensed code from Hibernate, the Hibernate code remains under the terms of the LGPL, but the other code in the generated binary is not affected by the licensing of the Hibernate code.
 
ASL 2.0
Some Hibernate projects are released under ASL 2.0.
 
This is mostly due to our work with the Java Community Process: implementing a reference implementation in practice requires such a liberal license (or a fully proprietary one strangely enough).</pre>

3. Distribution Obligations.
 
   3.1. Availability of Source Code.
 
   Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available
   in Executable form must also be made available in Source Code form
   and that Source Code form must be distributed only under the terms
   of this License. You must include a copy of this License with every
   copy of the Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute
   or otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any such
   Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can obtain such
   Covered Software in Source Code form in a reasonable manner on or
   through a medium customarily used for software exchange.
 
   3.2. Modifications.
 
   The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are
   governed by the terms of this License. You represent that You
   believe Your Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or You
   have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.
 
   3.3. Required Notices.
 
   You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that
   identifies You as the Contributor of the Modification. You may not
   remove or alter any copyright, patent or trademark notices contained
   within the Covered Software, or any notices of licensing or any
   descriptive text giving attribution to any Contributor or the
   Initial Developer.
 
   3.4. Application of Additional Terms.
 
   You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in
   Source Code form that alters or restricts the applicable version of
   this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. You may choose to
   offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or
   liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software.
   However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of
   the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it
   absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or
   liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree
   to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any
   liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a
   result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.
 
   3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.
 
   You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under
   the terms of this License or under the terms of a license of Your
   choice, which may contain terms different from this License,
   provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License
   and that the license for the Executable form does not attempt to
   limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code form from
   the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Covered
   Software in Executable form under a different license, You must make
   it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License
   are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or
   Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and
   every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial
   Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.
 
   3.6. Larger Works.
 
   You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with
   other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute
   the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make
   sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered
   Software.
 
4. Versions of the License.
 
   4.1. New Versions.
 
   Oracle is the initial license steward and may publish revised and/or
   new versions of this License from time to time. Each version will be
   given a distinguishing version number. Except as provided in Section
   4.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify
   this License.
 
   4.2. Effect of New Versions.
 
   You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the
   Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the
   License under which You originally received the Covered Software. If
   the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software
   prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available
   under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and
   make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version
   of the License under which You originally received the Covered
   Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or
   otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of any
   subsequent version of the License published by the license steward.
 
   4.3. Modified Versions.
 
   When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new
   license for Your Original Software, You may create and use a
   modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license and
   remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to
   note that the license differs from this License); and (b) otherwise
   make it clear that the license contains terms which differ from this
   License.
 
5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.
 
   COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,
   WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
   INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE
   IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR
   NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF
   THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE
   DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY
   OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING,
   REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN
   ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS
   AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.
 
6. TERMINATION.
 
   6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
   automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to
   cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach.
   Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the
   termination of this License shall survive.
 
   6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding
   declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a
   Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You
   assert such claim is referred to as "Participant") alleging that the
   Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the
   Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the
   Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly
   infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or
   indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if the
   Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors under
   Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice
   from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically at the
   expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60
   day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant
   Software against such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to
   a written agreement with Participant.
 
   6.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant
   alleging that the Participant Software directly or indirectly
   infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by
   license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent
   infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses
   granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken
   into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or
   license.
 
   6.4. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above,
   all end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any
   distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses
   granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.
 
7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
 
   UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
   (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE
   INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF
   COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE
   TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR
   CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
   LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER
   FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR
   LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE
   POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT
   APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH
   PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH
   LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR
   LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION
   AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 
8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.
 
   The Covered Software is a "commercial item," as that term is defined
   in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer
   software" (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. §
   252.227-7014(a)(1)) and "commercial computer software documentation"
   as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent
   with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4
   (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software
   with only those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights
   clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other
   clause or provision that addresses Government rights in computer
   software under this License.
 
9. MISCELLANEOUS.
 
   This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
   matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
   unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
   necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by
   the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within
   the Original Software (except to the extent applicable law, if any,
   provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdiction's conflict-of-law
   provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject
   to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and
   venue specified in a notice contained within the Original Software,
   with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without
   limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses.
   The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for
   the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or
   regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be
   construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. You
   agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the United
   States export administration regulations (and the export control
   laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute
   or otherwise make available any Covered Software.
 
10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.
 
   As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
   responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,
   out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to
   work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such
   responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or
   shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
 
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
 
For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.
You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
 
We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.
 
Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.
 
Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must
be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
 
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.
 
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
 
0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under
the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers
to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means
either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is
to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
(Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
"modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
 
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is
covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
(independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
is true depends on what the Program does.
 
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
 
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
 
2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
that you also meet all of these conditions:
 
   a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
   stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
 
   b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
   whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
   thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
   under the terms of this License.
 
   c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
   when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
   interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
   announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
   that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
   warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
   conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
   (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not
   normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program
   is not required to print an announcement.)
 
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and
can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on
the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
 
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.
 
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
scope of this License.
 
3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
 
   a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
   source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
   and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
 
   b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
   years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost
   of physically performing source distribution, a complete
   machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
   distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
   customarily used for software interchange; or,
 
   c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
   distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
   only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
   program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
   accord with Subsection b above.)
 
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special
exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
executable.
 
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access
to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source
code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source
along with the object code.
 
4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
full compliance.
 
5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all
its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
Program or works based on it.
 
6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
 
7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would
not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
distribution of the Program.
 
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.
 
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented
by public license practices. Many people have made generous
contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that
system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to
the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
 
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be
a consequence of the rest of this License.
 
8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may
add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
limitation as if written in the body of this License.
 
9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
 
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the
Free Software Foundation.
 
10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
 
NO WARRANTY
 
11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH
YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
 
12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
(INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR
OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 
END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
 
How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
 
If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
 
To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
 
   One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.
   Copyright (C) &lt;year> &lt;name of author>
 
   This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
   it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
   the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
   (at your option) any later version.
 
   This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
   WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
   MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
   General Public License for more details.
 
   You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
   along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
   Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1335 USA
 
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
 
If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:
 
   Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
   Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type
   `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute
   it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
 
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands
you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they
could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
 
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:
 
   Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
   program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by
   James Hacker.
 
   signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989
   Ty Coon, President of Vice
 
This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you
may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications
with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library
General Public License instead of this License.
 
#
 
Certain source files distributed by Oracle America, Inc. and/or its
affiliates are subject to the following clarification and special
exception to the GPLv2, based on the GNU Project exception for its
Classpath libraries, known as the GNU Classpath Exception, but only
where Oracle has expressly included in the particular source file's
header the words "Oracle designates this particular file as subject to
the "Classpath" exception as provided by Oracle in the LICENSE file
that accompanied this code."
 
You should also note that Oracle includes multiple, independent
programs in this software package. Some of those programs are provided
under licenses deemed incompatible with the GPLv2 by the Free Software
Foundation and others.  For example, the package includes programs
licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0.  Such programs are
licensed to you under their original licenses.
 
Oracle facilitates your further distribution of this package by adding
the Classpath Exception to the necessary parts of its GPLv2 code, which
permits you to use that code in combination with other independent
modules not licensed under the GPLv2.  However, note that this would
not permit you to commingle code under an incompatible license with
Oracle's GPLv2 licensed code by, for example, cutting and pasting such
code into a file also containing Oracle's GPLv2 licensed code and then
distributing the result.  Additionally, if you were to remove the
Classpath Exception from any of the files to which it applies and
distribute the result, you would likely be required to license some or
all of the other code in that distribution under the GPLv2 as well, and
since the GPLv2 is incompatible with the license terms of some items
included in the distribution by Oracle, removing the Classpath
Exception could therefore effectively compromise your ability to
further distribute the package.
 
Proceed with caution and we recommend that you obtain the advice of a
lawyer skilled in open source matters before removing the Classpath
Exception or making modifications to this package which may
subsequently be redistributed and/or involve the use of third party
software.
 
CLASSPATH EXCEPTION
Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is
making a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and
conditions of the GNU General Public License version 2 cover the whole
combination.
 
As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent
modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under
terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked
independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that
module.  An independent module is a module which is not derived from or
based on this library.  If you modify this library, you may extend this
exception to your version of the library, but you are not obligated to
do so.  If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement
from your version.</pre>

     "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
     transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
     not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
     and conversions to other media types.
 
     "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
     Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
     copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
     (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
 
     "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
     form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
     editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
     represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
     of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
     separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
     the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
 
     "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
     the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
     to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
     submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
     or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
     the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
     means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
     to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
     communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
     and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
     Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
     excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
     designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
 
     "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
     on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
     subsequently incorporated within the Work.
 
  2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
     this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
     worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
     copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
     publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
     Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
 
  3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
     this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
     worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
     (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
     use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
     where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
     by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
     Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
     with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
     institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
     cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
     or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
     or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
     granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
     as of the date such litigation is filed.
 
  4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
     Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
     modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
     meet the following conditions:
 
     (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
         Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
 
     (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
         stating that You changed the files; and
 
     (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
         that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
         attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
         excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
         the Derivative Works; and
 
     (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
         distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
         include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
         within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
         pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
         of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
         as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
         documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
         within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
         wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
         of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
         do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
         notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
         or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
         that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
         as modifying the License.
 
     You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
     may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
     for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
     for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
     reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
     the conditions stated in this License.
 
  5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
     any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
     by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
     this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
     Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
     the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
     with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
 
  6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
     names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
     except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
     origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
 
  7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
     agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
     Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
     WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
     implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
     of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
     PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
     appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
     risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
 
  8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
     whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
     unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
     negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
     liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
     incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
     result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
     Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
     work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
     other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
     has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
 
  9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
     the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
     and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
     or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
     License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
     on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
     of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
     defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
     incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
     of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

     direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
     otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
     outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
 
     "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
     exercising permissions granted by this License.
 
     "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
     including but not limited to software source code, documentation
     source, and configuration files.
 
     "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
     transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
     not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
     and conversions to other media types.
 
     "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
     Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
     copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
     (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
 
     "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
     form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
     editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
     represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
     of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
     separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
     the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
 
     "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
     the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
     to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
     submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
     or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
     the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
     means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
     to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
     communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
     and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
     Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
     excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
     designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
 
     "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
     on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
     subsequently incorporated within the Work.
 
  2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
     this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
     worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
     copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
     publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
     Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
 
  3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
     this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
     worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
     (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
     use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
     where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
     by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
     Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
     with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
     institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
     cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
     or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
     or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
     granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
     as of the date such litigation is filed.
 
  4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
     Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
     modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
     meet the following conditions:
 
     (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
         Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
 
     (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
         stating that You changed the files; and
 
     (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
         that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
         attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
         excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
         the Derivative Works; and
 
     (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
         distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
         include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
         within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
         pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
         of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
         as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
         documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
         within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
         wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
         of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
         do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
         notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
         or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
         that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
         as modifying the License.
 
     You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
     may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
     for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
     for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
     reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
     the conditions stated in this License.
 
  5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
     any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
     by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
     this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
     Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
     the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
     with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
 
  6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
     names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
     except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
     origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
 
  7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
     agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
     Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
     WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
     implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
     of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
     PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
     appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
     risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
 
  8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
     whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
     unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
     negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
     liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
     incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
     result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
     Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
     work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
     other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
     has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
 
  9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
     the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
     and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
     or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
     License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
     on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
     of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
     defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
     incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
     of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
 
  END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
