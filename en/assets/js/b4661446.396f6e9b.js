It also counts\nas the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\nthe version number 2.1.]\n \nPreamble\n \nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom\nto share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses\nare intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n \nThis license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\nspecially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\nFree Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You\ncan use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\nthis license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\nstrategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations\nbelow.\n \nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\nnot price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\nyou have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\nfor this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\nit if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\nit in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\nthese things.\n \nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\ndistributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\nrights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\nyou if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\n \nFor example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\nor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\nyou. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\ncode. If you link other code with the library, you must provide\ncomplete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\nwith the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\nit. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n \nWe protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\nlibrary, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\npermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\n \nTo protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there\nis no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified\nby someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what\nthey have is not the original version, so that the original author's\nreputation will not be affected by problems that might be introduced\nby others.\n \nFinally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\nany free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot\neffectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\nrestrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that\nany patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\nconsistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\n \nMost GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\nordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\nis quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use\nthis license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\nlibraries into non-free programs.\n \nWhen a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a\nshared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\ncombined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary\nGeneral Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\nentire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General\nPublic License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\nthe library.\n \nWe call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it\ndoes Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\nPublic License. It also provides other free software developers Less\nof an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages\nare the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\nlibraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\nspecial circumstances.\n \nFor example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\nencourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it\nbecomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must\nbe allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free\nlibrary does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this\ncase, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\nsoftware only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\n \nIn other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\nprograms enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\nfree software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\nnon-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\noperating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\nsystem.\n \nAlthough the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\nusers' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\nlinked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\nthat program using a modified version of the Library.\n \nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a\n\"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\". The\nformer contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\nbe combined with the library in order to run.  TERMS AND CONDITIONS\nFOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n \n0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\nprogram which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\nother authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\nthis Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\"). Each\nlicensee is addressed as \"you\".\n \nA \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data\nprepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\n(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n \nThe \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work\nwhich has been distributed under these terms. A \"work based on the\nLibrary\" means either the Library or any derivative work under\ncopyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\nportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\nstraightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is\nincluded without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n \n\"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means\nall the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\ninterface definition files, plus the scripts used to control\ncompilation and installation of the library.\n \nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of\nrunning a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\nsuch a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\non the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\nwriting it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and\nwhat the program that uses the Library does.\n \n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\ncomplete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\nyou conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\nappropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\nall the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\nwarranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\nLibrary.\n \nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\nfee.\n \n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of\nit, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute\nsuch modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above,\nprovided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n \n   * a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n \n   * b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\n     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n \n   * c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\n       charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n \n   * d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or\n     a table of data to be supplied by an application program that\n     uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the\n     facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to\n     ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such\n     function or table, the facility still operates, and performs\n     whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.\n \n     (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots\n     has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\n     application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\n     application-supplied function or table used by this function\n     must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the\n     square root function must still compute square roots.)\n \nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\nit.\n \nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Library.\n \nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\nwith the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n \n3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\nLicense instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do\nthis, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\nthat they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\ninstead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the\nordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\nthat version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in\nthese notices.\n \nOnce this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that\ncopy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\nsubsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n \nThis option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the\nLibrary into a program that is not a library.\n \n4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative\nof it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the\nterms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with\nthe complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be\ndistributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\ncustomarily used for software interchange.\n \nIf distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from\na designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source\ncode from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the\nsource code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the\nsource along with the object code.\n \n5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\nLibrary, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\nlinked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\". Such a work,\nin isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore\nfalls outside the scope of this License.\n \nHowever, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library\ncreates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\ncontains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the\nlibrary\". The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section\n6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n \nWhen a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file\nthat is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\nderivative work of the Library even though the source code is\nnot. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\nlinked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The\nthreshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n \nIf such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure\nlayouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions\n(ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is\nunrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\nwork. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\nLibrary will still fall under Section 6.)\n \nOtherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\ndistribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section\n6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\nwhether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n \n6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link\na \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a work\ncontaining portions of the Library, and distribute that work under\nterms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of\nthe work for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for\ndebugging such modifications.\n \nYou must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\nLibrary is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\nthis License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work\nduring execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\ncopyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\ndirecting the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one\nof these things:\n \n   * a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\n     machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\n     changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\n     Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable\n     linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable\n     \"work that uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code,\n     so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to\n     produce a modified executable containing the modified\n     Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the\n     contents of definitions files in the Library will not\n     necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the\n     modified definitions.)\n   *  b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n     Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\n     copy of the library already present on the user's computer\n     system, rather than copying library functions into the\n     executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified\n     version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the\n     modified version is interface-compatible with the version that\n     the work was made with.\n   *  c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least\n     three years, to give the same user the materials specified in\n     Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of\n     performing this distribution.\n   * d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to\n     copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy\n     the above specified materials from the same place.\n   * e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\n     materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n \nFor an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the\nLibrary\" must include any data and utility programs needed for\nreproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception,\nthe materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\nnormally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\ncomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\nwhich the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\nthe executable.\n \nIt may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\nrestrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\naccompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot\nuse both them and the Library together in an executable that you\ndistribute.\n \n7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side-by-side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\nlibrary, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\nthe Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\npermitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n \n   * a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\n     based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\n     facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the\n     Sections above.\n \n   *  b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\n     that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\n     where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n \n8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the\nLibrary except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the\nLibrary is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights,\nfrom you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so\nlong as such parties remain in full compliance.\n \n9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Library or works based on it.\n \n10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\nsubject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted\nherein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third\nparties with this License.\n \n11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n \nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n \nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system which is\nimplemented by public license practices. Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n \nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n \n12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Library under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n \n13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\nversions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such\nnew versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\ndiffer in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n \nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\n\"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that version or of any later version published by\nthe Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a\nlicense version number, you may choose any version ever published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.\n \n14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\nwrite to the author to ask for permission. For software which is\ncopyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\nSoftware Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our\ndecision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\nof all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\nand reuse of software generally.\n \nNO WARRANTY\n \n15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\nWARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE\nLAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS\nAND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF\nANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\nLIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\nTHE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n \n16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\nWRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\nAND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\nFOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\nCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\nLIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\nRENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\nFAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\nSUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\nDAMAGES.

To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent\nmust be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n \nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n \n                     GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n 0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a\n    notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\n    under the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\",\n    below, refers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on\n    the Program\" means either the Program or any derivative work under\n    copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a\n    portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or\n    translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\n    included without limitation in the term \"modification\".)  Each\n    licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n \n    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are\n    not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act\n    of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the\n    Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on\n    the Program (independent of having been made by running the\n    Program).  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n \n 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\n    source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\n    conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\n    copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\n    notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\n    warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of\n    this License along with the Program.\n \n    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\n    and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange\n    for a fee.\n \n 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\n    of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\n    distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\n    above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n \n      a. You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n         stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n \n      b. You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that\n         in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program\n         or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge\n         to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n \n      c. If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n         when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n         interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display\n         an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and\n         a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you\n         provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the\n         program under these conditions, and telling the user how to\n         view a copy of this License.  (Exception: if the Program\n         itself is interactive but does not normally print such an\n         announcement, your work based on the Program is not required\n         to print an announcement.)\n \n    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\n    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the\n    Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate\n    works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not\n    apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate\n    works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a\n    whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of\n    the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions\n    for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each\n    and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n \n    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or\n    contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the\n    intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of\n    derivative or collective works based on the Program.\n \n    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the\n    Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on\n    a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the\n    other work under the scope of this License.\n \n 3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\n    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms\n    of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the\n    following:\n \n      a. Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n         source code, which must be distributed under the terms of\n         Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for\n         software interchange; or,\n \n      b. Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n         years, to give any third-party, for a charge no more than your\n         cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n         machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n         distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\n         medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n \n      c. Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n         to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n         allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n         received the program in object code or executable form with\n         such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n \n    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\n    making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete\n    source code means all the source code for all modules it contains,\n    plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts\n    used to control compilation and installation of the executable.\n    However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need\n    not include anything that is normally distributed (in either\n    source or binary form) with the major components (compiler,\n    kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable\n    runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.\n \n    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\n    access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\n    access to copy the source code from the same place counts as\n    distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\n    compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n \n 4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\n    except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\n    otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\n    void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this\n    License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights,\n    from you under this License will not have their licenses\n    terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n \n 5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\n    signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify\n    or distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions\n    are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.\n    Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work\n    based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this\n    License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,\n    distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.\n \n 6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\n    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\n    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program\n    subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any\n    further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights\n    granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance\n    by third parties to this License.\n \n 7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\n    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent\n    issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,\n    agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this\n    License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this\n    License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously\n    your obligations under this License and any other pertinent\n    obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the\n    Program at all.  For example, if a patent license would not permit\n    royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who\n    receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only\n    way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain\n    entirely from distribution of the Program.\n \n    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable\n    under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is\n    intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply\n    in other circumstances.\n \n    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\n    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of\n    any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting\n    the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is\n    implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\n    generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\n    through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\n    system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is\n    willing to distribute software through any other system and a\n    licensee cannot impose that choice.\n \n    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed\n    to be a consequence of the rest of this License.\n \n 8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\n    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,\n    the original copyright holder who places the Program under this\n    License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation\n    excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only\n    in or among countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this\n    License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of\n    this License.\n \n 9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\n    versions of the General Public License from time to time.  Such\n    new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but\n    may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n \n    Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\n    Program specifies a version number of this License which applies\n    to it and \"any later version\", you have the option of following\n    the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later\n    version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Program\n    does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose\n    any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n \n10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\n    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the\n    author to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted\n    by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software\n    Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our decision\n    will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of\n    all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\n    and reuse of software generally.\n \n                               NO WARRANTY\n11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\n    WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE\n    LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\n    HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT\n    WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT\n    NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND\n    FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE\n    QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\n    PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY\n    SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n \n12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\n    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY\n    MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE\n    LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,\n    INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR\n    INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\n    DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU\n    OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY\n    OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN\n    ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n \n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n \nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n=============================================\n \nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these\nterms.\n \nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to\nattach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey\nthe exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the\n\"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n \n    ONE LINE TO GIVE THE PROGRAM'S NAME AND A BRIEF IDEA OF WHAT IT DOES.\n    Copyright (C) YYYY  NAME OF AUTHOR\n \n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n \n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n \n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software\n    Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307, USA.\n \nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n \nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\nwhen it starts in an interactive mode:\n \n    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19YY NAME OF AUTHOR\n    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n \nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the\nappropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the\ncommands you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show\nc'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your\nprogram.\n \nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\nnecessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\n \n    Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\n    `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\n \n    SIGNATURE OF TY COON, 1 April 1989\n    Ty Coon, President of Vice\n \nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\ninto proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library,\nyou may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary\napplications with the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the\nGNU Library General Public License instead of this License.\n"

Time Zone Database\n \n     ICU uses the public domain data and code derived from Time Zone\n   Database for its time zone support. The ownership of the TZ database\n   is explained in BCP 175: Procedure for Maintaining the Time Zone\n   Database section 7.\n \n    # 7.  Database Ownership\n    #\n    #    The TZ database itself is not an IETF Contribution or an IETF\n    #    document.  Rather it is a pre-existing and regularly updated work\n    #    that is in the public domain, and is intended to remain in the\n    #    public domain.  Therefore, BCPs 78 [RFC5378] and 79 [RFC3979] do\n    #    not apply to the TZ Database or contributions that individuals make\n    #    to it.  Should any claims be made and substantiated against the TZ\n    #    Database, the organization that is providing the IANA\n    #    Considerations defined in this RFC, under the memorandum of\n    #    understanding with the IETF, currently ICANN, may act in accordance\n    #    with all competent court orders.  No ownership claims will be made\n    #    by ICANN or the IETF Trust on the database or the code.  Any person\n    #    making a contribution to the database or code waives all rights to\n    #    future claims in that contribution or in the TZ Database.\n \"\"\"\n \n- libuv, located at deps/uv, is licensed as follows:\n \"\"\"\n   libuv is part of the Node project: http://nodejs.org/\n   libuv may be distributed alone under Node's license:\n \n   ====\n \n   Copyright Joyent, Inc. and other Node contributors.

If the\n   terms of this license do not permit the full use that you propose to\n   make of the Package, you should contact the Copyright Holder and seek\n   a different licensing arrangement.\n \n   Definitions\n \n       \"Copyright Holder\" means the individual(s) or organization(s)\n       named in the copyright notice for the entire Package.\n \n       \"Contributor\" means any party that has contributed code or other\n       material to the Package, in accordance with the Copyright Holder's\n       procedures.\n \n       \"You\" and \"your\" means any person who would like to copy,\n       distribute, or modify the Package.\n \n       \"Package\" means the collection of files distributed by the\n       Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection and/or of\n       those files. A given Package may consist of either the Standard\n       Version, or a Modified Version.\n \n       \"Distribute\" means providing a copy of the Package or making it\n       accessible to anyone else, or in the case of a company or\n       organization, to others outside of your company or organization.\n \n       \"Distributor Fee\" means any fee that you charge for Distributing\n       this Package or providing support for this Package to another\n       party.  It does not mean licensing fees.\n \n       \"Standard Version\" refers to the Package if it has not been\n       modified, or has been modified only in ways explicitly requested\n       by the Copyright Holder.\n \n       \"Modified Version\" means the Package, if it has been changed, and\n       such changes were not explicitly requested by the Copyright\n       Holder.\n \n       \"Original License\" means this Artistic License as Distributed with\n       the Standard Version of the Package, in its current version or as\n       it may be modified by The Perl Foundation in the future.\n \n       \"Source\" form means the source code, documentation source, and\n       configuration files for the Package.\n \n       \"Compiled\" form means the compiled bytecode, object code, binary,\n       or any other form resulting from mechanical transformation or\n       translation of the Source form.\n \n   Permission for Use and Modification Without Distribution\n \n   (1)  You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use\n   Modified Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that\n   you do not Distribute the Modified Version.\n \n   Permissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version\n \n   (2)  You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the\n   Standard Version of this Package in any medium without restriction,\n   either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, provided that you duplicate\n   all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.  At\n   your discretion, such verbatim copies may or may not include a\n   Compiled form of the Package.\n \n   (3)  You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other\n   modifications made available from the Copyright Holder.  The resulting\n   Package will still be considered the Standard Version, and as such\n   will be subject to the Original License.\n \n   Distribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source\n \n   (4)  You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis\n   or for a Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the\n   Modified Version) provided that you clearly document how it differs\n   from the Standard Version, including, but not limited to, documenting\n   any non-standard features, executables, or modules, and provided that\n   you do at least ONE of the following:\n \n       (a)  make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder\n       of the Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the\n       Copyright Holder may include your modifications in the Standard\n       Version.\n \n       (b)  ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not\n       prevent the user installing or running the Standard Version. In\n       addition, the Modified Version must bear a name that is different\n       from the name of the Standard Version.\n \n       (c)  allow anyone who receives a copy of the Modified Version to\n       make the Source form of the Modified Version available to others\n       under\n \n           (i)  the Original License or\n \n           (ii)  a license that permits the licensee to freely copy,\n           modify and redistribute the Modified Version using the same\n           licensing terms that apply to the copy that the licensee\n           received, and requires that the Source form of the Modified\n           Version, and of any works derived from it, be made freely\n           available in that license fees are prohibited but Distributor\n           Fees are allowed.\n \n   Distribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version\n   or Modified Versions without the Source\n \n   (5)  You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without\n   the Source, provided that you include complete instructions on how to\n   get the Source of the Standard Version.  Such instructions must be\n   valid at the time of your distribution.  If these instructions, at any\n   time while you are carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you\n   must provide new instructions on demand or cease further distribution.\n   If you provide valid instructions or cease distribution within thirty\n   days after you become aware that the instructions are invalid, then\n   you do not forfeit any of your rights under this license.\n \n   (6)  You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without\n   the Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to\n   the Source of the Modified Version.\n \n   Aggregating or Linking the Package\n \n   (7)  You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or\n   Modified Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting\n   aggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the\n   Package.  Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other\n   components in the aggregation are permitted. The terms of this license\n   apply to the use and Distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions\n   as included in the aggregation.\n \n   (8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with\n   other works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to\n   build stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of applications that\n   include the Package, and Distribute the result without restriction,\n   provided the result does not expose a direct interface to the Package.\n \n   Items That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version\n \n   (9) Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that\n   merely extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause\n   the Package to be a Modified Version.  In addition, such works are not\n   considered parts of the Package itself, and are not subject to the\n   terms of this license.\n \n   General Provisions\n \n   (10)  Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or\n   Modified Versions is governed by this Artistic License. By using,\n   modifying or distributing the Package, you accept this license. Do not\n   use, modify, or distribute the Package, if you do not accept this\n   license.\n \n   (11)  If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified\n   Version made by someone other than you, you are nevertheless required\n   to ensure that your Modified Version complies with the requirements of\n   this license.\n \n   (12)  This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark,\n   service mark, tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder.\n \n   (13)  This license includes the non-exclusive, worldwide,\n   free-of-charge patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell,\n   sell, import and otherwise transfer the Package with respect to any\n   patent claims licensable by the Copyright Holder that are necessarily\n   infringed by the Package. If you institute patent litigation\n   (including a cross-claim or counterclaim) against any party alleging\n   that the Package constitutes direct or contributory patent\n   infringement, then this Artistic License to you shall terminate on the\n   date that such litigation is filed.\n \n   (14)  Disclaimer of Warranty:\n   THE PACKAGE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS\n   IS' AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES.

Additional Definitions.\nAs used herein, “this License” refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public License, and the “GNU GPL” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n“The Library” refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.\nAn “Application” is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface provided by the Library.\nA “Combined Work” is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with the Library. The particular version of the Library with which the Combined Work was made is also called the “Linked Version”.\nThe “Minimal Corresponding Source” for a Combined Work means the Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.\nThe “Corresponding Application Code” for a Combined Work means the object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\n1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\nYou may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n2. Conveying Modified Versions.\nIf you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified version:\na) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\nb) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License applicable to that copy.\n3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\nThe object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\na) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.\nb) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n4. Combined Works.\nYou may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of the following:\na) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.\nb) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.\nc) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.\nd) Do one of the following:\n0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.\n1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked Version.\ne) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is necessary to install and execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)\n5. Combined Libraries.\nYou may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by side in a single library together with other library facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:\na) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the terms of this License.\nb) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that published version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\nIf the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.\n"

This interpretation applies regardless of whether a binary that includes Hibernate code is designed to run on the JVM or is a native image generated through use of tools and frameworks like GraalVM and Quarkus.\n \nMore detailed explanation\nThe original version of the LGPL was written in 1991 with embedded C programming in mind, before Java existed. This has sometimes led to questions about how to interpret LGPL in a Java context. The “L” in LGPL originally stood for “library”; LGPL was designed to enable libraries to be used by proprietary applications in situations that might be impermissible under the ordinary GPL. For this reason, the LGPL is classified as a “weak copyleft” license, in contrast to the GPL which is considered a “strong copyleft”. The “L” in LGPL was later reinterpreted to mean “lesser”, to communicate the fact that it has more limited scope than the GPL and is not meant exclusively for libraries.\n \nBy the 2000s, the LGPL had become one of the most widely used and best known open source licenses. At this time, some Java developers naturally began to adopt the LGPL for their projects as a more permissive and flexible alternative to the GPL. For projects like Hibernate, the LGPL had a simple interpretation in the Java setting, which can be summarized as follows:\n \nLGPL requirements are triggered only if there is distribution; internal use is not restricted.\n \nDistributors of binaries built from LGPL-licensed source code must comply with the LGPL by providing source code corresponding only to the LGPL-covered parts of the binary.\n \nThere is no requirement to publish independent code that, for example, merely imports LGPL-covered packages or classes. Such independent code can be under different licensing terms, including proprietary licensing terms or other open source licenses.\n \nModifications of LGPL-licensed source code, if distributed, must be licensed under the LGPL.\n \nThis has been the consistent interpretation of the LGPL by the maintainers of Hibernate ever since the project adopted LGPL.\n \nUse in GraalVM native images\nRecently there has been interest in native compilation for Java using tools like GraalVM, such as commonly used in frameworks like Quarkus. The view of the Hibernate maintainers is that native compilation is a technical detail that does not fundamentally change how LGPL works for Java code. In a native image that includes LGPL-licensed code from Hibernate, the Hibernate code remains under the terms of the LGPL, but the other code in the generated binary is not affected by the licensing of the Hibernate code.\n \nASL 2.0\nSome Hibernate projects are released under ASL 2.0.\n \nThis is mostly due to our work with the Java Community Process: implementing a reference implementation in practice requires such a liberal license (or a fully proprietary one strangely enough).\n"

Contributor Grant.\n \n   Conditioned upon Your compliance with Section 3.1 below and subject\n   to third party intellectual property claims, each Contributor hereby\n   grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license:\n \n   (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or\n   trademark) Licensable by Contributor to use, reproduce, modify,\n   display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Modifications\n   created by such Contributor (or portions thereof), either on an\n   unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as Covered Software\n   and/or as part of a Larger Work; and\n \n   (b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or selling\n   of Modifications made by that Contributor either alone and/or in\n   combination with its Contributor Version (or portions of such\n   combination), to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or\n   otherwise dispose of: (1) Modifications made by that Contributor (or\n   portions thereof); and (2) the combination of Modifications made by\n   that Contributor with its Contributor Version (or portions of such\n   combination).\n \n   (c) The licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) are effective\n   on the date Contributor first distributes or otherwise makes the\n   Modifications available to a third party.\n \n   (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent license is\n   granted: (1) for any code that Contributor has deleted from the\n   Contributor Version; (2) for infringements caused by: (i) third\n   party modifications of Contributor Version, or (ii) the combination\n   of Modifications made by that Contributor with other software\n   (except as part of the Contributor Version) or other devices; or (3)\n   under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of\n   Modifications made by that Contributor.\n \n3. Distribution Obligations.\n \n   3.1. Availability of Source Code.\n \n   Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available\n   in Executable form must also be made available in Source Code form\n   and that Source Code form must be distributed only under the terms\n   of this License. You must include a copy of this License with every\n   copy of the Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute\n   or otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any such\n   Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can obtain such\n   Covered Software in Source Code form in a reasonable manner on or\n   through a medium customarily used for software exchange.\n \n   3.2. Modifications.\n \n   The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are\n   governed by the terms of this License. You represent that You\n   believe Your Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or You\n   have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.\n \n   3.3. Required Notices.\n \n   You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that\n   identifies You as the Contributor of the Modification. You may not\n   remove or alter any copyright, patent or trademark notices contained\n   within the Covered Software, or any notices of licensing or any\n   descriptive text giving attribution to any Contributor or the\n   Initial Developer.\n \n   3.4. Application of Additional Terms.\n \n   You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in\n   Source Code form that alters or restricts the applicable version of\n   this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. You may choose to\n   offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or\n   liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software.\n   However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of\n   the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it\n   absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or\n   liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree\n   to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any\n   liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a\n   result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\n \n   3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.\n \n   You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under\n   the terms of this License or under the terms of a license of Your\n   choice, which may contain terms different from this License,\n   provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License\n   and that the license for the Executable form does not attempt to\n   limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code form from\n   the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Covered\n   Software in Executable form under a different license, You must make\n   it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License\n   are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or\n   Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and\n   every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial\n   Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.\n \n   3.6. Larger Works.\n \n   You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with\n   other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute\n   the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make\n   sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered\n   Software.\n \n4. Versions of the License.\n \n   4.1. New Versions.\n \n   Oracle is the initial license steward and may publish revised and/or\n   new versions of this License from time to time. Each version will be\n   given a distinguishing version number. Except as provided in Section\n   4.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify\n   this License.\n \n   4.2. Effect of New Versions.\n \n   You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the\n   Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the\n   License under which You originally received the Covered Software. If\n   the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software\n   prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available\n   under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and\n   make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version\n   of the License under which You originally received the Covered\n   Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or\n   otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of any\n   subsequent version of the License published by the license steward.\n \n   4.3. Modified Versions.\n \n   When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new\n   license for Your Original Software, You may create and use a\n   modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license and\n   remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to\n   note that the license differs from this License); and (b) otherwise\n   make it clear that the license contains terms which differ from this\n   License.\n \n5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\n \n   COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n   WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,\n   INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE\n   IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR\n   NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF\n   THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE\n   DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY\n   OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING,\n   REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN\n   ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS\n   AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\n \n6. TERMINATION.\n \n   6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate\n   automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to\n   cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach.\n   Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the\n   termination of this License shall survive.\n \n   6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding\n   declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a\n   Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You\n   assert such claim is referred to as \"Participant\") alleging that the\n   Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the\n   Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the\n   Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly\n   infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or\n   indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if the\n   Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors under\n   Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice\n   from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically at the\n   expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60\n   day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant\n   Software against such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to\n   a written agreement with Participant.\n \n   6.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant\n   alleging that the Participant Software directly or indirectly\n   infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by\n   license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent\n   infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses\n   granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken\n   into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or\n   license.\n \n   6.4. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above,\n   all end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any\n   distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses\n   granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.\n \n7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\n \n   UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT\n   (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE\n   INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF\n   COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE\n   TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR\n   CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT\n   LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER\n   FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR\n   LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE\n   POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT\n   APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH\n   PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH\n   LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR\n   LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION\n   AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n \n8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\n \n   The Covered Software is a \"commercial item,\" as that term is defined\n   in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of \"commercial computer\n   software\" (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. §\n   252.227-7014(a)(1)) and \"commercial computer software documentation\"\n   as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent\n   with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4\n   (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software\n   with only those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights\n   clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other\n   clause or provision that addresses Government rights in computer\n   software under this License.\n \n9. MISCELLANEOUS.\n \n   This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject\n   matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\n   unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent\n   necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by\n   the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within\n   the Original Software (except to the extent applicable law, if any,\n   provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdiction's conflict-of-law\n   provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject\n   to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and\n   venue specified in a notice contained within the Original Software,\n   with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without\n   limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses.\n   The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for\n   the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or\n   regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be\n   construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. You\n   agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the United\n   States export administration regulations (and the export control\n   laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute\n   or otherwise make available any Covered Software.\n \n10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.\n \n   As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is\n   responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,\n   out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to\n   work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such\n   responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or\n   shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.\n \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \nNOTICE PURSUANT TO SECTION 9 OF THE COMMON DEVELOPMENT AND DISTRIBUTION\nLICENSE (CDDL)\n \nThe code released under the CDDL shall be governed by the laws of the\nState of California (excluding conflict-of-law provisions). Any\nlitigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction\nof the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California and the\nstate courts of the State of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara\nCounty, California.\n \n \n \n The GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2, June 1991\n \nCopyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor\nBoston, MA 02110-1335\nUSA\n \nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\nof this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n \nPreamble\n \nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to\nshare and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is\nintended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to\nmake sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public\nLicense applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and\nto any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free\nSoftware Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General\nPublic License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.\n \nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.\nOur General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the\nfreedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this\nservice if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n \nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone\nto deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These\nrestrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n \nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis\nor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.\nYou must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.\nAnd you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n \nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n \nAlso, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n \nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nWe wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will\nindividually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program\nproprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must\nbe licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n \nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n \nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n \n0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a\nnotice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under\nthe terms of this General Public License. The \"Program\", below, refers\nto any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\" means\neither the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is\nto say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either\nverbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.\n(Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term\n\"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n \nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running\nthe Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is\ncovered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program\n(independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that\nis true depends on what the Program does.\n \n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source\ncode as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously\nand appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice\nand disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to\nthis License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other\nrecipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.\n \nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n \n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of\nit, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute\nsuch modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided\nthat you also meet all of these conditions:\n \n   a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n   stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n \n   b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n   whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part\n   thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties\n   under the terms of this License.\n \n   c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n   when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n   interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n   announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice\n   that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a\n   warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these\n   conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.\n   (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not\n   normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program\n   is not required to print an announcement.)\n \nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and\ncan be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on\nthe Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this\nLicense, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire\nwhole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n \nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n \nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a\nstorage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the\nscope of this License.\n \n3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n \n   a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n   source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1\n   and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n \n   b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n   years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost\n   of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n   machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n   distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n   customarily used for software interchange; or,\n \n   c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to\n   distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed\n   only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the\n   program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in\n   accord with Subsection b above.)\n \nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code\nmeans all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control\ncompilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special\nexception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is\nnormally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\ncomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\nwhich the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the\nexecutable.\n \nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access\nto copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy\nthe source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source\ncode, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source\nalong with the object code.\n \n4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise\nto copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will\nautomatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties\nwho have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will\nnot have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in\nfull compliance.\n \n5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all\nits terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the\nProgram or works based on it.\n \n6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions\non the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not\nresponsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.\n \n7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute\nso as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and\nany other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not\ndistribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would\nnot permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who\nreceive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you\ncould satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from\ndistribution of the Program.\n \nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n \nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented\nby public license practices. Many people have made generous\ncontributions to the wide range of software distributed through that\nsystem in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to\nthe author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute\nsoftware through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.\n \nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be\na consequence of the rest of this License.\n \n8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License may\nadd an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those\ncountries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries\nnot thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the\nlimitation as if written in the body of this License.\n \n9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\nversions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new\nversions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\ndiffer in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n \nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that version or of any later version published by\nthe Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version\nnumber of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the\nFree Software Foundation.\n \n10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the\nauthor to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the\nFree Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we\nsometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the\ntwo goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free\nsoftware and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n \nNO WARRANTY\n \n11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\nWARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\nEXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\nOTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED\nWARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE\nENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH\nYOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL\nNECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n \n12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\nWRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\nAND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR\nDAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL\nDAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM\n(INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED\nINACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF\nTHE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR\nOTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n \nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n \nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n \nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n \nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to\nattach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey\nthe exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the\n\"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n \n   One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.\n   Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>\n \n   This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n   it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n   the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n   (at your option) any later version.\n \n   This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but\n   WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n   MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU\n   General Public License for more details.\n \n   You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n   along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software\n   Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1335 USA\n \nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n \nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\nwhen it starts in an interactive mode:\n \n   Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author\n   Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type\n   `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute\n   it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n \nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the\nappropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands\nyou use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they\ncould even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n \nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\nnecessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:\n \n   Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the\n   program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by\n   James Hacker.\n \n   signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989\n   Ty Coon, President of Vice\n \nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\ninto proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you\nmay consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications\nwith the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library\nGeneral Public License instead of this License.\n \n#\n \nCertain source files distributed by Oracle America, Inc. and/or its\naffiliates are subject to the following clarification and special\nexception to the GPLv2, based on the GNU Project exception for its\nClasspath libraries, known as the GNU Classpath Exception, but only\nwhere Oracle has expressly included in the particular source file's\nheader the words \"Oracle designates this particular file as subject to\nthe \"Classpath\" exception as provided by Oracle in the LICENSE file\nthat accompanied this code.\"\n \nYou should also note that Oracle includes multiple, independent\nprograms in this software package. Some of those programs are provided\nunder licenses deemed incompatible with the GPLv2 by the Free Software\nFoundation and others.  For example, the package includes programs\nlicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0.  Such programs are\nlicensed to you under their original licenses.\n \nOracle facilitates your further distribution of this package by adding\nthe Classpath Exception to the necessary parts of its GPLv2 code, which\npermits you to use that code in combination with other independent\nmodules not licensed under the GPLv2.  However, note that this would\nnot permit you to commingle code under an incompatible license with\nOracle's GPLv2 licensed code by, for example, cutting and pasting such\ncode into a file also containing Oracle's GPLv2 licensed code and then\ndistributing the result.  Additionally, if you were to remove the\nClasspath Exception from any of the files to which it applies and\ndistribute the result, you would likely be required to license some or\nall of the other code in that distribution under the GPLv2 as well, and\nsince the GPLv2 is incompatible with the license terms of some items\nincluded in the distribution by Oracle, removing the Classpath\nException could therefore effectively compromise your ability to\nfurther distribute the package.\n \nProceed with caution and we recommend that you obtain the advice of a\nlawyer skilled in open source matters before removing the Classpath\nException or making modifications to this package which may\nsubsequently be redistributed and/or involve the use of third party\nsoftware.\n \nCLASSPATH EXCEPTION\nLinking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is\nmaking a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and\nconditions of the GNU General Public License version 2 cover the whole\ncombination.\n \nAs a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you\npermission to link this library with independent modules to produce an\nexecutable, regardless of the license terms of these independent\nmodules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under\nterms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked\nindependent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that\nmodule.  An independent module is a module which is not derived from or\nbased on this library.  If you modify this library, you may extend this\nexception to your version of the library, but you are not obligated to\ndo so.  If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement\nfrom your version.\n"

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n     the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n     and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n     or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n     License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n     on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n     of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n     defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n     incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n     of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n \n  END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n \n  APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n \n     To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n     boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n     replaced with your own identifying information.
