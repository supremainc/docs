#### Correct fingerprint input method[​](#cautions-enrolling-fingers "Direct link to Correct fingerprint input method")

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

In order to improve the fingerprint authentication rate, enroll the fingerprint correctly. This product can authenticate fingerprints even if the user's fingerprint input angle and position change. If you enroll the fingerprint with attention to the following matters, the authentication rate can be improved.

##### Selecting a finger for fingerprint input[​](#selecting-a-finger-for-fingerprint-input "Direct link to Selecting a finger for fingerprint input")

![](/docs/en/img/device/fingerprint-selection.svg)

* In preparation for the case that the fingerprint of a specific finger cannot be used, for example if the user is lifting a load with one hand or a finger gets hurt, up to 10 fingerprints for each user can be enrolled.

* In the case of a user whose fingerprint cannot be recognized well, the authentication rate can be improved by enrolling the same finger twice repeatedly.

* If a finger has a cut or the fingerprint is blurry, select another finger for the fingerprint.

* It is recommended to use the index finger or the middle finger when scanning the fingerprint. The authentication rate can be reduced if it is difficult to place another finger at the center of fingerprint sensor accurately.

##### Fingerprint enroll method[​](#fingerprint-enroll-method "Direct link to Fingerprint enroll method")

1. Place the finger you want to enroll on the fingerprint recognition unit and gently press it so that the fingerprint is authenticated well.

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

![](/docs/en/img/device/fingerprint-register.svg)

2. After the "beep" sound, scan the fingerprint of the enrolled finger again. (scan the fingerprint of a finger to be enrolled twice)

<!-- -->

###### Cautions for fingerprint enrollment[​](#cautions-enrolling-fingerprint "Direct link to Cautions for fingerprint enrollment")

When a fingerprint is recognized, it is compared with the initially enrolled fingerprint, so the initial fingerprint enroll is the most important. Pay attention to the following matters when enrolling the fingerprint.

![](/docs/en/img/device/fingerprint-authentication.svg)

* Place the finger deep enough to contact with the sensor completely.

* Place the center of the fingerprint in the center of the sensor.

* If a finger has a cut or the fingerprint is blurry, select another finger for the fingerprint.

* Scan the fingerprint correctly without moving according to the instruction on the screen.

* If you make the finger upright so that the contact area with the sensor is decreased or the angle of finger is warped, fingerprint authentication may not be performed.

###### If fingerprint authentication does not work well[​](#if-fingerprint-authentication-does-not-work-well "Direct link to If fingerprint authentication does not work well")

This product can authenticate fingerprints regardless of seasonal changes or changes in the condition of the fingers. However, the authentication rate may vary according to the external environment or fingerprint input method. If the fingerprint authentication cannot be done smoothly, it is recommended to take the following measures.

* If the finger is smeared with water or sweat, dry off the finger and then scan the finger.

* If the finger is too dry, blow your breath on the fingertips and then scan the finger.

* If the finger has a cut, enroll the fingerprint of another finger.

* Since the initially enrolled fingerprint is often not input correctly, please re-enroll the fingerprint according to the [cautions for fingerprint enrollment](#cautions-enrolling-fingerprint).

Info

* The device can be used as a multi-door controller with the slave devices with the RS-485 cable. The slave devices are used as dummy readers and authentication is performed in the master device.

- If XPass or XPass 2 is connected to the master device, only card authentication can be used.

* The maximum number of slave devices available to connect varies according to the authentication method, number of users, and number of devices. Also note that the number of slave devices affects the authentication performance.

* Connect up to 31 slave devices to a master device. The bandwidth of RS-485 allows for up to 7 fingerprint authentication devices to be connected.

#### Correct fingerprint input method[​](#cautions-enrolling-fingers "Direct link to Correct fingerprint input method")

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

In order to improve the fingerprint authentication rate, enroll the fingerprint correctly. This product can authenticate fingerprints even if the user's fingerprint input angle and position change. If you enroll the fingerprint with attention to the following matters, the authentication rate can be improved.

##### Selecting a finger for fingerprint input[​](#selecting-a-finger-for-fingerprint-input "Direct link to Selecting a finger for fingerprint input")

![](/docs/en/img/device/fingerprint-selection.svg)

* In preparation for the case that the fingerprint of a specific finger cannot be used, for example if the user is lifting a load with one hand or a finger gets hurt, up to 10 fingerprints for each user can be enrolled.

* In the case of a user whose fingerprint cannot be recognized well, the authentication rate can be improved by enrolling the same finger twice repeatedly.

* If a finger has a cut or the fingerprint is blurry, select another finger for the fingerprint.

* It is recommended to use the index finger or the middle finger when scanning the fingerprint. The authentication rate can be reduced if it is difficult to place another finger at the center of fingerprint sensor accurately.

##### Fingerprint enroll method[​](#fingerprint-enroll-method "Direct link to Fingerprint enroll method")

1. Place the finger you want to enroll on the fingerprint recognition unit and gently press it so that the fingerprint is authenticated well.

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

![](/docs/en/img/device/fingerprint-register.svg)

2. After the "beep" sound, scan the fingerprint of the enrolled finger again. (scan the fingerprint of a finger to be enrolled twice)

<!-- -->

###### Cautions for fingerprint enrollment[​](#cautions-enrolling-fingerprint "Direct link to Cautions for fingerprint enrollment")

When a fingerprint is recognized, it is compared with the initially enrolled fingerprint, so the initial fingerprint enroll is the most important. Pay attention to the following matters when enrolling the fingerprint.

![](/docs/en/img/device/fingerprint-authentication.svg)

* Place the finger deep enough to contact with the sensor completely.

* Place the center of the fingerprint in the center of the sensor.

* If a finger has a cut or the fingerprint is blurry, select another finger for the fingerprint.

* Scan the fingerprint correctly without moving according to the instruction on the screen.

* If you make the finger upright so that the contact area with the sensor is decreased or the angle of finger is warped, fingerprint authentication may not be performed.

###### If fingerprint authentication does not work well[​](#if-fingerprint-authentication-does-not-work-well "Direct link to If fingerprint authentication does not work well")

This product can authenticate fingerprints regardless of seasonal changes or changes in the condition of the fingers. However, the authentication rate may vary according to the external environment or fingerprint input method. If the fingerprint authentication cannot be done smoothly, it is recommended to take the following measures.

* If the finger is smeared with water or sweat, dry off the finger and then scan the finger.

* If the finger is too dry, blow your breath on the fingertips and then scan the finger.

* If the finger has a cut, enroll the fingerprint of another finger.

* Since the initially enrolled fingerprint is often not input correctly, please re-enroll the fingerprint according to the [cautions for fingerprint enrollment](#cautions-enrolling-fingerprint).

#### Power supply connection[​](#power-supply-connection "Direct link to Power supply connection")

![](/docs/en/img/en/device/installation-power-connection-ber2.png)

Caution

* Use the IEC/EN 62368-1 approved power adapter that supports higher power consumption than the product. If you wish to connect and use another device to the power supply adapter, you should use an adapter with a current capacity which is the same or larger than the total power consumption required for the terminal and another device.

  * Refer to the [Power](/docs/en/device/bioentry_r2/product-specifications#specs.power) in the product specifications for maximum current consumption specifications.

* DO NOT extend the length of power cable when using the power adapter.

* Use a separate power supply for Secure I/O 2, the electric lock, and the product respectively. If connecting and using the power supply to these devices together, the devices may malfunction.

* Use an AWG24 twisted pair with a maximum length of 1.2 km for the RS-485 cable.

* It is recommended to use RS-485 cables with a characteristic impedance of 120 Ω.

* If connecting with a RS-485 daisy chain, connect the termination resistor (120 Ω) to both ends of the daisy chain connection. If connected to the middle line, the signal level becomes smaller and the communication performance will deteriorate. Make sure to connect it to both ends of the daisy chain connection.

* If XPass or XPass 2 is connected to the master device, only card authentication can be used.

#### Correct fingerprint input method[​](#cautions-enrolling-fingers "Direct link to Correct fingerprint input method")

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

In order to improve the fingerprint authentication rate, enroll the fingerprint correctly. This product can authenticate fingerprints even if the user's fingerprint input angle and position change. If you enroll the fingerprint with attention to the following matters, the authentication rate can be improved.

##### Selecting a finger for fingerprint input[​](#selecting-a-finger-for-fingerprint-input "Direct link to Selecting a finger for fingerprint input")

![](/docs/en/img/device/fingerprint-selection.svg)

* In preparation for the case that the fingerprint of a specific finger cannot be used, for example if the user is lifting a load with one hand or a finger gets hurt, up to 10 fingerprints for each user can be enrolled.

* In the case of a user whose fingerprint cannot be recognized well, the authentication rate can be improved by enrolling the same finger twice repeatedly.

* If a finger has a cut or the fingerprint is blurry, select another finger for the fingerprint.

* It is recommended to use the index finger or the middle finger when scanning the fingerprint. The authentication rate can be reduced if it is difficult to place another finger at the center of fingerprint sensor accurately.

##### Fingerprint enroll method[​](#fingerprint-enroll-method "Direct link to Fingerprint enroll method")

1. Place the finger you want to enroll on the fingerprint recognition unit and gently press it so that the fingerprint is authenticated well.

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

![](/docs/en/img/device/fingerprint-register.svg)

2. After the "beep" sound, scan the fingerprint of the enrolled finger again. (scan the fingerprint of a finger to be enrolled twice)

<!-- -->

###### Cautions for fingerprint enrollment[​](#cautions-enrolling-fingerprint "Direct link to Cautions for fingerprint enrollment")

When a fingerprint is recognized, it is compared with the initially enrolled fingerprint, so the initial fingerprint enroll is the most important. Pay attention to the following matters when enrolling the fingerprint.

![](/docs/en/img/device/fingerprint-authentication.svg)

* Place the finger deep enough to contact with the sensor completely.

* Place the center of the fingerprint in the center of the sensor.

* If a finger has a cut or the fingerprint is blurry, select another finger for the fingerprint.

* Scan the fingerprint correctly without moving according to the instruction on the screen.

* If you make the finger upright so that the contact area with the sensor is decreased or the angle of finger is warped, fingerprint authentication may not be performed.

###### If fingerprint authentication does not work well[​](#if-fingerprint-authentication-does-not-work-well "Direct link to If fingerprint authentication does not work well")

This product can authenticate fingerprints regardless of seasonal changes or changes in the condition of the fingers. However, the authentication rate may vary according to the external environment or fingerprint input method. If the fingerprint authentication cannot be done smoothly, it is recommended to take the following measures.

* If the finger is smeared with water or sweat, dry off the finger and then scan the finger.

* If the finger is too dry, blow your breath on the fingertips and then scan the finger.

* If the finger has a cut, enroll the fingerprint of another finger.

* Since the initially enrolled fingerprint is often not input correctly, please re-enroll the fingerprint according to the [cautions for fingerprint enrollment](#cautions-enrolling-fingerprint).

* Do not raise head up or lower head.

* Do not wear thick makeup.

* Do not close your eyes.

* Make sure that both of your shoulders correctly appear on the screen.

* Stand still and enroll your face by staring at the screen.

* Be careful not to display two faces on the screen. Enroll one person at a time.

* If you do not follow the instructions on the screen, the face enrollment may take longer or may fail.

##### Cautions for authenticating a face[​](#cautions-authenticating-face "Direct link to Cautions for authenticating a face")

* Ensure that the face appears in the center of the device’s screen. When the guideline is displayed, follow the instructions shown on the screen to authenticate the face.

* If a part of the face is covered with a hat, a mask, an eye patch, or sunglasses authentication may fail. Do not cover the face; allow the device to recognize both the eyebrows and the face.

* Authenticate at a location <!-- -->60~100 cm<!-- --> away from the device.

* Make sure that both of your shoulders correctly appear on the screen. Authentication may fail if your shoulders are not at the same height. Stand still, and then authenticate your face.

- Use a separate power supply for Secure I/O 2, the electric lock, and the product respectively. If connecting and using the power supply to these devices together, the devices may malfunction.

* When connecting the power supply, be aware of the distance between the device and the power supply. The device should be connected as close as possible to the power supply so that the length of the connecting cable is kept to a minimum. If cable connections are made improperly it may cause the device to malfunction. It is recommended to use a 16 AWG or 18 AWG cable if the product is far from the power supply. The connection distance may differ depending on the standard of the cable used and the installation environment. This product supports both DC 24 V and DC 12 V power, so check the maximum length according to the cable specification to ensure that the unit is properly powered.

  | Cable standard | Max. extended length |        |
  | -------------- | -------------------- | ------ |
  |                | DC 12V               | DC 24V |
  | 16 AWG         | 50 m                 | 150 m  |
  | 18 AWG         | 30 m                 | 136 m  |
  | 20 AWG         | 20 m                 | 90 m   |

- DO NOT extend the length of power cable when using the power adapter.

* DO NOT use the CAT5 UTP 2-Wire for power supply purpose.

Caution

* Install a diode at both sides of the door lock wire as shown in the figure to protect the relay from the reverse current, which occurs when the door lock operates.

* Use a separate power supply for the product and the door lock.

* Suprema’s standalone intelligent readers contain internal relays that can directly lock/unlock doors without external controllers for added convenience. For access control applications in need of security, however, it is NOT recommended to use the internal relay of a reader to prevent any tampering attacks which can potentially trigger the door unlock. For such applications, it is highly recommended to use a separate relay unit for a lock control such as Suprema’s Secure I/O 2, DM-20 or CoreStation installed at a secure side of a door.

Info

Take caution of the installation direction of the diode. Install the diode close to the door lock.

##### Fail Secure Lock[​](#fail-secure-lock "Direct link to Fail Secure Lock")

* In preparation for the case that the fingerprint of a specific finger cannot be used, for example if the user is lifting a load with one hand or a finger gets hurt, up to 10 fingerprints for each user can be enrolled.

* In the case of a user whose fingerprint cannot be recognized well, the authentication rate can be improved by enrolling the same finger twice repeatedly.

* If a finger has a cut or the fingerprint is blurry, select another finger for the fingerprint.

* It is recommended to use the index finger or the middle finger when scanning the fingerprint. The authentication rate can be reduced if it is difficult to place another finger at the center of fingerprint sensor accurately.

##### Fingerprint enroll method[​](#fingerprint-enroll-method "Direct link to Fingerprint enroll method")

<!-- -->

1. When the screen displays "Please input your fingerprint," place the finger you want to enroll on the fingerprint recognition unit and gently press it so that the fingerprint is authenticated well.

<!-- -->

![](/docs/en/img/device/fingerprint-register.svg)

<!-- -->

2. When the re-input screen is displayed after a beep sound, scan the fingerprint of the enrolled finger again. (scan the fingerprint of a finger to be enrolled twice)

###### Cautions for fingerprint enrollment[​](#cautions-enrolling-fingerprint "Direct link to Cautions for fingerprint enrollment")

When a fingerprint is recognized, it is compared with the initially enrolled fingerprint, so the initial fingerprint enroll is the most important. Pay attention to the following matters when enrolling the fingerprint.

![](/docs/en/img/device/fingerprint-authentication.svg)

* Place the finger deep enough to contact with the sensor completely.

* Place the center of the fingerprint in the center of the sensor.

* If a finger has a cut or the fingerprint is blurry, select another finger for the fingerprint.

* Scan the fingerprint correctly without moving according to the instruction on the screen.

* If you make the finger upright so that the contact area with the sensor is decreased or the angle of finger is warped, fingerprint authentication may not be performed.

###### If fingerprint authentication does not work well[​](#if-fingerprint-authentication-does-not-work-well "Direct link to If fingerprint authentication does not work well")

This product can authenticate fingerprints regardless of seasonal changes or changes in the condition of the fingers. However, the authentication rate may vary according to the external environment or fingerprint input method. If the fingerprint authentication cannot be done smoothly, it is recommended to take the following measures.

* If the finger is smeared with water or sweat, dry off the finger and then scan the finger.

* If the finger is too dry, blow your breath on the fingertips and then scan the finger.

* If the finger has a cut, enroll the fingerprint of another finger.

* Since the initially enrolled fingerprint is often not input correctly, please re-enroll the fingerprint according to the [cautions for fingerprint enrollment](#cautions-enrolling-fingerprint).

#### Correct fingerprint input method[​](#cautions-enrolling-fingers "Direct link to Correct fingerprint input method")

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

In order to improve the fingerprint authentication rate, enroll the fingerprint correctly. This product can authenticate fingerprints even if the user's fingerprint input angle and position change. If you enroll the fingerprint with attention to the following matters, the authentication rate can be improved.

##### Selecting a finger for fingerprint input[​](#selecting-a-finger-for-fingerprint-input "Direct link to Selecting a finger for fingerprint input")

![](/docs/en/img/device/fingerprint-selection.svg)

* In preparation for the case that the fingerprint of a specific finger cannot be used, for example if the user is lifting a load with one hand or a finger gets hurt, up to 10 fingerprints for each user can be enrolled.

* In the case of a user whose fingerprint cannot be recognized well, the authentication rate can be improved by enrolling the same finger twice repeatedly.

* If a finger has a cut or the fingerprint is blurry, select another finger for the fingerprint.

* It is recommended to use the index finger or the middle finger when scanning the fingerprint. The authentication rate can be reduced if it is difficult to place another finger at the center of fingerprint sensor accurately.

##### Fingerprint enroll method[​](#fingerprint-enroll-method "Direct link to Fingerprint enroll method")

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

1. When the screen displays "Please input your first fingerprint," place the finger you want to enroll on the fingerprint recognition unit and gently press it so that the fingerprint is authenticated well.

![](/docs/en/img/device/fingerprint-register.svg)

<!-- -->

2. When the re-input screen is displayed after a beep sound, scan the fingerprint of the enrolled finger again. (scan the fingerprint of a finger to be enrolled twice)

###### Cautions for fingerprint enrollment[​](#cautions-enrolling-fingerprint "Direct link to Cautions for fingerprint enrollment")

When a fingerprint is recognized, it is compared with the initially enrolled fingerprint, so the initial fingerprint enroll is the most important. Pay attention to the following matters when enrolling the fingerprint.

![](/docs/en/img/device/fingerprint-authentication.svg)

* Place the finger deep enough to contact with the sensor completely.

* Place the center of the fingerprint in the center of the sensor.

* If a finger has a cut or the fingerprint is blurry, select another finger for the fingerprint.

* Scan the fingerprint correctly without moving according to the instruction on the screen.

* If you make the finger upright so that the contact area with the sensor is decreased or the angle of finger is warped, fingerprint authentication may not be performed.

###### If fingerprint authentication does not work well[​](#if-fingerprint-authentication-does-not-work-well "Direct link to If fingerprint authentication does not work well")

This product can authenticate fingerprints regardless of seasonal changes or changes in the condition of the fingers. However, the authentication rate may vary according to the external environment or fingerprint input method. If the fingerprint authentication cannot be done smoothly, it is recommended to take the following measures.

* If the finger is smeared with water or sweat, dry off the finger and then scan the finger.

* If the finger is too dry, blow your breath on the fingertips and then scan the finger.

* If the finger has a cut, enroll the fingerprint of another finger.

* Since the initially enrolled fingerprint is often not input correctly, please re-enroll the fingerprint according to the [cautions for fingerprint enrollment](#cautions-enrolling-fingerprint).

Caution

* Install a diode at both sides of the door lock wire as shown in the figure to protect the relay from the reverse current, which occurs when the door lock operates.

* Use a separate power supply for the product and the door lock.

* Suprema’s standalone intelligent readers contain internal relays that can directly lock/unlock doors without external controllers for added convenience. For access control applications in need of security, however, it is NOT recommended to use the internal relay of a reader to prevent any tampering attacks which can potentially trigger the door unlock. For such applications, it is highly recommended to use a separate relay unit for a lock control such as Suprema’s Secure I/O 2, DM-20 or CoreStation installed at a secure side of a door.

Info

Take caution of the installation direction of the diode. Install the diode close to the door lock.

##### Fail Secure Lock[​](#fail-secure-lock "Direct link to Fail Secure Lock")

#### Connecting to Secure I/O 2[​](#connecting-to-secure-io-2 "Direct link to Connecting to Secure I/O 2")

Secure I/O 2 is an I/O device, can be connected to the product with the RS-485 cable. Security can be maintained even if the connection between the product and Secure I/O 2 has been lost or the power supply to the product has been shut off due to external factors.

* Use an AWG24 twisted pair with a maximum length of 1.2 km for the RS-485 cable.

* It is recommended to use RS-485 cables with a characteristic impedance of 120 Ω.

* If connecting with a RS-485 daisy chain, connect the termination resistor (120 Ω) to both ends of the daisy chain connection. If connected to the middle line, the signal level becomes smaller and the communication performance will deteriorate. Make sure to connect it to both ends of the daisy chain connection.

#### Set master administrator[​](#set-master-administrator "Direct link to Set master administrator")

The Master Admin feature enhances the overall admin privileges of the device to improve device security and prevent unauthorized access and configuration changes. **Enroll a master administrator** on new devices using this feature. Only the enrolled master administrator can access the administrator menu to change device setting.

What is a master administrator?

* If you use the device without setting an administrator, anyone can access the administrator menu and change device settings. The master administrator feature enforces overall administrator settings to address these security vulnerabilities.

* The master admin cannot delete directly and will be deleted only during Factory Default.

##### Enroll master administrator on a new device[​](#enroll-master-administrator-on-a-new-device "Direct link to Enroll master administrator on a new device")

On a new device, Master Admin must be registered from the beginning; if not registered, device usage will be restricted.

Info

* When the new device is booted for the first time, the Master Admin registration screen will appear. If Master Admin is not registered, you cannot proceed to the next screen.

* Register Master Admin to use all features, even if you connect to BioStar X and assign a device-wide administrator.

* New devices cannot perform firmware downgrades.

1. When the new device is booted for the first time, the Master Admin registration screen will appear.

- Do not raise head up or lower head.

- Do not wear thick makeup.

- Do not close your eyes.

- Make sure that both of your shoulders correctly appear on the screen.

- Stand still and enroll your face by staring at the screen.

- Be careful not to display two faces on the screen. Enroll one person at a time.

- If you do not follow the instructions on the screen, the face enrollment may take longer or may fail.

##### Cautions for authenticating a face[​](#cautions-authenticating-face "Direct link to Cautions for authenticating a face")

* Ensure that the face appears in the center of the device’s screen. When the guideline is displayed, follow the instructions shown on the screen to authenticate the face.

* If a part of the face is covered with a hat, a mask, an eye patch, or sunglasses authentication may fail. Do not cover the face; allow the device to recognize both the eyebrows and the face.

* Authenticate at a location <!-- -->40~80 cm<!-- --> away from the device.

* Make sure that both of your shoulders correctly appear on the screen. Authentication may fail if your shoulders are not at the same height. Stand still, and then authenticate your face.

#### Relay Connection[​](#relay-connection "Direct link to Relay Connection")

##### Fail Safe Lock[​](#fail-safe-lock "Direct link to Fail Safe Lock")

In order to use the Fail Safe Lock, connect N/C relay as shown in the figure below. There is normally a current flowing through the relay for the Fail Safe Lock. When the relay is activated, blocking the current flow, the door will open. If the power supply to the product is cut off due to a power failure or an external factor, the door will open.

Caution

* Install a diode at both sides of the door lock wire as shown in the figure to protect the relay from the reverse current, which occurs when the door lock operates.

* Use a separate power supply for the product and the door lock.

* Suprema’s standalone intelligent readers contain internal relays that can directly lock/unlock doors without external controllers for added convenience. For access control applications in need of security, however, it is NOT recommended to use the internal relay of a reader to prevent any tampering attacks which can potentially trigger the door unlock. For such applications, it is highly recommended to use a separate relay unit for a lock control such as Suprema’s Secure I/O 2, DM-20 or CoreStation installed at a secure side of a door.

Info

Take caution of the installation direction of the diode. Install the diode close to the door lock.

##### Fail Secure Lock[​](#fail-secure-lock "Direct link to Fail Secure Lock")

In order to use the Fail Secure Lock, connect N/O relay as shown in the figure below. There is normally no current flowing through the relay for the Fail Secure Lock. When the current flow is activated by the relay, the door will open. If the power supply to the product is cut off due to a power failure or an external factor, the door will lock.

Info

* The device can be used as a multi-door controller with the slave devices with the RS-485 cable. The slave devices are used as dummy readers and authentication is performed in the master device.

- If a fingerprint authentication device is configured as a slave device in <!-- -->FaceStation 2<!-- -->, you cannot add another <!-- -->FaceStation 2<!-- --> as a slave device.

- If the fingerprint authentication device is the master device, <!-- -->FaceStation 2<!-- --> cannot be added as a slave device.

- When you connect <!-- -->FaceStation 2<!-- --> as a slave device while <!-- -->FaceStation 2<!-- --> is the master device, only one <!-- -->FaceStation 2<!-- --> can be added as a slave device.

- When <!-- -->FaceStation 2<!-- --> is the master device and another <!-- -->FaceStation 2<!-- --> is connected to it as a slave device, you can connect one additional Secure I/O 2 and DM-20 each.

- When <!-- -->FaceStation 2<!-- --> is the master device and another <!-- -->FaceStation 2<!-- --> is connected to it as a slave device, you cannot connect additional OM-120.

* The maximum number of slave devices available to connect varies according to the authentication method, number of users, and number of devices. Also note that the number of slave devices affects the authentication performance.

* Connect up to 31 slave devices to a master device. The bandwidth of RS-485 allows for up to 7 fingerprint authentication devices to be connected.

#### Connecting to Secure I/O 2[​](#connecting-to-secure-io-2 "Direct link to Connecting to Secure I/O 2")

Secure I/O 2 is an I/O device, can be connected to the product with the RS-485 cable. Security can be maintained even if the connection between the product and Secure I/O 2 has been lost or the power supply to the product has been shut off due to external factors.

* Use an AWG24 twisted pair with a maximum length of 1.2 km for the RS-485 cable.

* It is recommended to use RS-485 cables with a characteristic impedance of 120 Ω.

* If connecting with a RS-485 daisy chain, connect the termination resistor (120 Ω) to both ends of the daisy chain connection. If connected to the middle line, the signal level becomes smaller and the communication performance will deteriorate. Make sure to connect it to both ends of the daisy chain connection.

Info

* When using Mask Detection or Thermal Camera, you can set Check Mode according to the device's purpose.

  * Check After Authentication: After authentication, check whether the user is wearing a mask or measure temperature.

  * Check Before Authentication: After checking whether the user is wearing a mask or measuring temperature, perform authentication. When using this mode, users without masks or exceeding the standard temperature cannot perform authentication.

  * Check Only: The device can only be used for checking whether a mask is worn or for measuring temperature. When using this mode, users wearing masks or below the standard temperature can enter regardless of authentication.

* When Thermal Camera is set to Enabled, advanced setting options for thermal imaging cameras are activated.

  * Celsius/Fahrenheit: You can set the temperature display unit.

  * Low Threshold Temperature: You can set the minimum reference temperature to restrict access. Users with surface temperatures lower than Low Threshold Temperature will be denied authentication. Low Threshold Temperature can be set in the range of 1℃~45℃ and cannot be set higher than High Threshold Temperature.

  * High Threshold Temperature: You can set the maximum reference temperature to restrict access. Users with surface temperatures higher than High Threshold Temperature will be denied authentication. High Threshold Temperature can be set in the range of 1℃~45℃ and cannot be set lower than Low Threshold Temperature.

  * Save Temperature Data: You can set whether to save the user's temperature log. Using this option, both the success of authentication and the user's temperature value will be saved in the log; if not used, only the success of authentication will be logged.

  * Show Thermal Infrared Image: Set whether to display infrared video on the device screen.

  * Dynamic ROI: Set the device to automatically detect the area of interest (ROI) for measuring the user's temperature. For example, if there are other lights installed nearby, this option allows the thermal imaging camera to detect and measure the user's temperature instead of that lighting.

  * Camera Configuration: Set detailed options for the camera for accurate measurement.

* When Thermal Camera is set to Enabled, you can set detailed options for the thermal imaging camera for accurate measurement according to the installation environment.

  * Distance(cm): Set the distance between the user and the thermal camera.

  * Emissivity: Set the infrared emissivity.

  * ROI X(%), ROI Y(%), ROI Width(%), ROI Height(%): You can set the ROI (Region of Interest) manually when Dynamic ROI is set to Not Use. Adjust the ROI location and size to specify the area where the thermal camera will measure temperature. ROI X(%) indicates the left and right positions of the region of interest, and the larger this value, the further the region moves to the right of the screen. ROI Y(%) indicates the top and bottom positions of the region of interest, and the larger this value, the further the region moves up. ROI Width(%) and ROI Height(%) indicate the size of the region of interest; as both values increase, the area for measuring temperature widens. For example, if the values of ROI X(%), ROI Y(%), ROI Width(%), ROI Height(%) are changed from default values to 40, 15, 70, 40 respectively, the region of interest will change as shown below.

  ![](/docs/en/img/device/auth-roi1.png)

  If the ROI is set to the default value

  ![](/docs/en/img/device/auth-roi2.png)

  ROI X(%), ROI Y(%), ROI width(%), ROI height(%)<br />When the values are changed to 40, 15, 70, and 40, respectively

  * Skin Temperature Compensation: You can set the thermal imaging camera to correct the temperature autonomously, considering the environmental usage of the device and the surrounding temperature.

  * Skin Temperature Correction: Depending on the product usage environment, you can adjust the temperature measures to be increased or decreased by a constant value. For example, if the temperature reading is always measured 0.1℃ higher, set the temperature correction value to -0.1.

  * FW: If the thermal imaging camera is properly connected, the firmware version of that camera will be displayed.

* For optimal performance, it is recommended to use default settings for the sub-options of Camera Configuration. The default values of each option are as follows:

  * Distance(cm): 100

  * Emissivity: 0.98

  * ROI X(%): 30

  * ROI Y(%): 25

  * ROI Width(%): 50

  * ROI Height(%): 55

  When using the ROI as the default setting, a yellow guide will be displayed in the ROI area of the screen during authentication as shown below. When the user's face is aligned within that area during authentication, accurate temperature measurements can be made. When manually changing the settings or using dynamic ROI, the yellow guide is not displayed.

  ![](/docs/en/img/en/device/auth-static-roi.png)

  If the ROI is set to the default value

  ![](/docs/en/img/en/device/auth-dynamic-roi.png)

##### Cautions for enrolling a faces[​](#cautions-enrolling-faces "Direct link to Cautions for enrolling a faces")

<!-- -->

* Keep the distance between the device and your face at 60-100 cm when enrolling your face.

<!-- -->

* Do not change your face expression.

* Do not wear masks, hats, or eye patches.

* Do not enroll a face wearing a mask. It may increase the False Acceptance Rate (FAR) if both faces with and without a mask are enrolled.

* Do not raise head up or lower head.

* Do not wear thick makeup.

* Do not close your eyes.

* Make sure that both of your shoulders correctly appear on the screen.

* Stand still and enroll your face by staring at the screen.

* Be careful not to display two faces on the screen. Enroll one person at a time.

* If you do not follow the instructions on the screen, the face enrollment may take longer or may fail.

##### Cautions for authenticating a face[​](#cautions-authenticating-face "Direct link to Cautions for authenticating a face")

* Ensure that the face appears in the center of the device’s screen. When the guideline is displayed, follow the instructions shown on the screen to authenticate the face.

* If a part of the face is covered with a hat, a mask, an eye patch, or sunglasses authentication may fail. Do not cover the face; allow the device to recognize both the eyebrows and the face.

* Authenticate at a location <!-- -->90~100 cm<!-- --> away from the device.

* Make sure that both of your shoulders correctly appear on the screen. Authentication may fail if your shoulders are not at the same height. Stand still, and then authenticate your face.

#### Correct fingerprint input method FSF2-ODB[​](#cautions-enrolling-fingers "Direct link to cautions-enrolling-fingers")

<!-- -->

In order to improve the fingerprint authentication rate, enroll the fingerprint correctly. This product can authenticate fingerprints even if the user's fingerprint input angle and position change. If you enroll the fingerprint with attention to the following matters, the authentication rate can be improved.

##### Selecting a finger for fingerprint input[​](#selecting-a-finger-for-fingerprint-input "Direct link to Selecting a finger for fingerprint input")

![](/docs/en/img/device/fingerprint-selection.svg)

* In preparation for the case that the fingerprint of a specific finger cannot be used, for example if the user is lifting a load with one hand or a finger gets hurt, up to 10 fingerprints for each user can be enrolled.

* In the case of a user whose fingerprint cannot be recognized well, the authentication rate can be improved by enrolling the same finger twice repeatedly.

* If a finger has a cut or the fingerprint is blurry, select another finger for the fingerprint.

* It is recommended to use the index finger or the middle finger when scanning the fingerprint. The authentication rate can be reduced if it is difficult to place another finger at the center of fingerprint sensor accurately.

##### Fingerprint enroll method[​](#fingerprint-enroll-method "Direct link to Fingerprint enroll method")

<!-- -->

1. When the screen displays "Please input your fingerprint," place the finger you want to enroll on the fingerprint recognition unit and gently press it so that the fingerprint is authenticated well.

<!-- -->

![](/docs/en/img/device/fingerprint-register.svg)

<!-- -->

2. When the re-input screen is displayed after a beep sound, scan the fingerprint of the enrolled finger again. (scan the fingerprint of a finger to be enrolled twice)

###### Cautions for fingerprint enrollment[​](#cautions-enrolling-fingerprint "Direct link to Cautions for fingerprint enrollment")

When a fingerprint is recognized, it is compared with the initially enrolled fingerprint, so the initial fingerprint enroll is the most important. Pay attention to the following matters when enrolling the fingerprint.

![](/docs/en/img/device/fingerprint-authentication.svg)

* Place the finger deep enough to contact with the sensor completely.

* Place the center of the fingerprint in the center of the sensor.

* If a finger has a cut or the fingerprint is blurry, select another finger for the fingerprint.

* Scan the fingerprint correctly without moving according to the instruction on the screen.

* If you make the finger upright so that the contact area with the sensor is decreased or the angle of finger is warped, fingerprint authentication may not be performed.

###### If fingerprint authentication does not work well[​](#if-fingerprint-authentication-does-not-work-well "Direct link to If fingerprint authentication does not work well")

This product can authenticate fingerprints regardless of seasonal changes or changes in the condition of the fingers. However, the authentication rate may vary according to the external environment or fingerprint input method. If the fingerprint authentication cannot be done smoothly, it is recommended to take the following measures.

* If the finger is smeared with water or sweat, dry off the finger and then scan the finger.

* If the finger is too dry, blow your breath on the fingertips and then scan the finger.

* If the finger has a cut, enroll the fingerprint of another finger.

* Since the initially enrolled fingerprint is often not input correctly, please re-enroll the fingerprint according to the [cautions for fingerprint enrollment](#cautions-enrolling-fingerprint).

Info

* The device can be used as a multi-door controller with the slave devices with the RS-485 cable. The slave devices are used as dummy readers and authentication is performed in the master device.

- If a fingerprint authentication device is configured as a slave device in <!-- -->FaceStation F2<!-- -->, you cannot add another <!-- -->FaceStation F2<!-- --> as a slave device.

- If the fingerprint authentication device is the master device, <!-- -->FaceStation F2<!-- --> cannot be added as a slave device.

- When you connect <!-- -->FaceStation F2<!-- --> as a slave device while <!-- -->FaceStation F2<!-- --> is the master device, only one <!-- -->FaceStation F2<!-- --> can be added as a slave device.

- When <!-- -->FaceStation F2<!-- --> is the master device and another <!-- -->FaceStation F2<!-- --> is connected to it as a slave device, you can connect one additional Secure I/O 2 and DM-20 each.

- When <!-- -->FaceStation F2<!-- --> is the master device and another <!-- -->FaceStation F2<!-- --> is connected to it as a slave device, you cannot connect additional OM-120.

* FaceStation F2
  <!-- -->
  cannot be used as a slave device when
  <!-- -->
  BioStation 3

#### RS-485 Connection[​](#rs-485-connection "Direct link to RS-485 Connection")

![](/docs/en/img/en/device/installation-rs485-connection-sio2.png)

Info

* Use an AWG24 twisted pair with a maximum length of 1.2 km for the RS-485 cable.

* It is recommended to use RS-485 cables with a characteristic impedance of 120 Ω.

* If connecting with a RS-485 daisy chain, connect the termination resistor (120 Ω) to both ends of the daisy chain connection. If connected to the middle line, the signal level becomes smaller and the communication performance will deteriorate. Make sure to connect it to both ends of the daisy chain connection.

Caution

* Install a diode at both sides of the door lock wire as shown in the figure to protect the relay from the reverse current, which occurs when the door lock operates.

* Use a separate power supply for the product and the door lock.

* Suprema’s standalone intelligent readers contain internal relays that can directly lock/unlock doors without external controllers for added convenience. For access control applications in need of security, however, it is NOT recommended to use the internal relay of a reader to prevent any tampering attacks which can potentially trigger the door unlock. For such applications, it is highly recommended to use a separate relay unit for a lock control such as Suprema’s Secure I/O 2, DM-20 or CoreStation installed at a secure side of a door.

Info

Take caution of the installation direction of the diode. Install the diode close to the door lock.

##### Fail Secure Lock[​](#fail-secure-lock "Direct link to Fail Secure Lock")

#### Connecting to Secure I/O 2[​](#connecting-to-secure-io-2 "Direct link to Connecting to Secure I/O 2")

Secure I/O 2 is an I/O device, can be connected to the product with the RS-485 cable. Security can be maintained even if the connection between the product and Secure I/O 2 has been lost or the power supply to the product has been shut off due to external factors.

* Use an AWG24 twisted pair with a maximum length of 1.2 km for the RS-485 cable.

* It is recommended to use RS-485 cables with a characteristic impedance of 120 Ω.

* If connecting with a RS-485 daisy chain, connect the termination resistor (120 Ω) to both ends of the daisy chain connection. If connected to the middle line, the signal level becomes smaller and the communication performance will deteriorate. Make sure to connect it to both ends of the daisy chain connection.

Caution

* Install a diode at both sides of the door lock wire as shown in the figure to protect the relay from the reverse current, which occurs when the door lock operates.

* Use a separate power supply for the product and the door lock.

* Suprema’s standalone intelligent readers contain internal relays that can directly lock/unlock doors without external controllers for added convenience. For access control applications in need of security, however, it is NOT recommended to use the internal relay of a reader to prevent any tampering attacks which can potentially trigger the door unlock. For such applications, it is highly recommended to use a separate relay unit for a lock control such as Suprema’s Secure I/O 2, DM-20 or CoreStation installed at a secure side of a door.

Info

Take caution of the installation direction of the diode. Install the diode close to the door lock.

##### Fail Secure Lock[​](#fail-secure-lock "Direct link to Fail Secure Lock")

In order to use the Fail Secure Lock, connect N/O relay as shown in the figure below. There is normally no current flowing through the relay for the Fail Secure Lock.

#### Connecting to Secure I/O 2[​](#connecting-to-secure-io-2 "Direct link to Connecting to Secure I/O 2")

Secure I/O 2 is an I/O device, can be connected to the product with the RS-485 cable. Security can be maintained even if the connection between the product and Secure I/O 2 has been lost or the power supply to the product has been shut off due to external factors.

* Use an AWG24 twisted pair with a maximum length of 1.2 km for the RS-485 cable.

* It is recommended to use RS-485 cables with a characteristic impedance of 120 Ω.

* If connecting with a RS-485 daisy chain, connect the termination resistor (120 Ω) to both ends of the daisy chain connection. If connected to the middle line, the signal level becomes smaller and the communication performance will deteriorate. Make sure to connect it to both ends of the daisy chain connection.

#### Correct fingerprint input method XS2-ODPB, XS2-OAPB[​](#cautions-enrolling-fingers "Direct link to cautions-enrolling-fingers")

In order to improve the fingerprint authentication rate, enroll the fingerprint correctly. This product can authenticate fingerprints even if the user's fingerprint input angle and position change. If you enroll the fingerprint with attention to the following matters, the authentication rate can be improved.

##### Selecting a finger for fingerprint input[​](#selecting-a-finger-for-fingerprint-input "Direct link to Selecting a finger for fingerprint input")

![](/docs/en/img/device/fingerprint-selection.svg)

* In preparation for the case that the fingerprint of a specific finger cannot be used, for example if the user is lifting a load with one hand or a finger gets hurt, up to 10 fingerprints for each user can be enrolled.

* In the case of a user whose fingerprint cannot be recognized well, the authentication rate can be improved by enrolling the same finger twice repeatedly.

* If a finger has a cut or the fingerprint is blurry, select another finger for the fingerprint.

* It is recommended to use the index finger or the middle finger when scanning the fingerprint. The authentication rate can be reduced if it is difficult to place another finger at the center of fingerprint sensor accurately.

##### Fingerprint enroll method[​](#fingerprint-enroll-method "Direct link to Fingerprint enroll method")

<!-- -->

1. When the screen displays "Please input your fingerprint," place the finger you want to enroll on the fingerprint recognition unit and gently press it so that the fingerprint is authenticated well.

<!-- -->

![](/docs/en/img/device/fingerprint-register.svg)

<!-- -->

2. When the re-input screen is displayed after a beep sound, scan the fingerprint of the enrolled finger again. (scan the fingerprint of a finger to be enrolled twice)

###### Cautions for fingerprint enrollment[​](#cautions-enrolling-fingerprint "Direct link to Cautions for fingerprint enrollment")

When a fingerprint is recognized, it is compared with the initially enrolled fingerprint, so the initial fingerprint enroll is the most important. Pay attention to the following matters when enrolling the fingerprint.

![](/docs/en/img/device/fingerprint-authentication.svg)

* Place the finger deep enough to contact with the sensor completely.

* Place the center of the fingerprint in the center of the sensor.

* If a finger has a cut or the fingerprint is blurry, select another finger for the fingerprint.

* Scan the fingerprint correctly without moving according to the instruction on the screen.

* If you make the finger upright so that the contact area with the sensor is decreased or the angle of finger is warped, fingerprint authentication may not be performed.

###### If fingerprint authentication does not work well[​](#if-fingerprint-authentication-does-not-work-well "Direct link to If fingerprint authentication does not work well")

This product can authenticate fingerprints regardless of seasonal changes or changes in the condition of the fingers. However, the authentication rate may vary according to the external environment or fingerprint input method. If the fingerprint authentication cannot be done smoothly, it is recommended to take the following measures.

* If the finger is smeared with water or sweat, dry off the finger and then scan the finger.

* If the finger is too dry, blow your breath on the fingertips and then scan the finger.

* If the finger has a cut, enroll the fingerprint of another finger.

* Since the initially enrolled fingerprint is often not input correctly, please re-enroll the fingerprint according to the [cautions for fingerprint enrollment](#cautions-enrolling-fingerprint).

#### Notes on QR/Barcode and Device License[​](#notes-on-qrbarcode-and-device-license "Direct link to Notes on QR/Barcode and Device License")

##### Correct QR/Barcode Authentication Method[​](#how-to-scan-qrbarcode "Direct link to Correct QR/Barcode Authentication Method")

You can issue a QR/barcode to the user for use as a means of authentication. To improve recognition rate, scan the QR/barcode correctly according to the guidance on the screen.

XS2-DPB, XS2-APB

![](/docs/en/img/device/qr-scanning-xs2.svg)

* Keep the distance between the device's camera and the QR/barcode at 5-20 cm.

* Position the QR/barcode so that it is centered in the device's scanning screen.

* If authenticating with a QR/barcode downloaded to a mobile device, adjust the brightness of the mobile device to ensure the screen is clearly visible.

* Failure to follow the instructions on the screen may result in slow recognition or failure of the QR/barcode.

XS2-QDPB, XS2-QAPB

![](/docs/en/img/device/qr-scanning-xs2-q.svg)

* Keep the distance between the device's QR/barcode recognition unit and the QR/barcode at 5-20 cm.

* Ensure the device's QR/barcode recognition unit is horizontal to the QR/barcode being scanned, and position the guide beam in the center of the QR/barcode.

* If authenticating with a QR/barcode downloaded to a mobile device, adjust the brightness of the mobile device to ensure the screen is clearly visible.

* Failure to follow the instructions on the screen may result in slow recognition or failure of the QR/barcode.

XS2-ODPB, XS2-OAPB

![](/docs/en/img/device/qr-scanning-xs2-finger.svg)

* Keep the distance between the device's camera and the QR/barcode at 5-20 cm.

* Position the QR/barcode so that it is centered in the device's scanning screen.

* If authenticating with a QR/barcode downloaded to a mobile device, adjust the brightness of the mobile device to ensure the screen is clearly visible.

* Failure to follow the instructions on the screen may result in slow recognition or failure of the QR/barcode.

The image above is an example screen and may differ from the actual screen.

Warning

* If you activate **Admin 2-step Authentication** and then delete credentials so that all administrators have fewer than two types, you will not be able to access the administrator menu if BioStar 2 connection is also unavailable. Therefore, exercise caution when deleting administrator credentials.

#### Additional Information[​](#additional-information "Direct link to Additional Information")

* **Manual Device Hash Key Change**

  * When manually changing the device hash key, a warning message will indicate that Master Admin PINs will be deleted. Please confirm the message before proceeding.

* **RS-485 Biometric Image Transmission Restriction**

  * Biometric credential images are not transmitted over RS-485 communication, so substitute images appear when viewing the registered Master Admin face on slave devices.

#### GNU General Public License[​](#gnu-general-public-license "Direct link to GNU General Public License")

Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <[https://fsf.org/>](https://fsf.org/%3E)

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

##### Preamble[​](#preamble "Direct link to Preamble")

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.

Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.

##### TERMS AND CONDITIONS[​](#terms-and-conditions "Direct link to TERMS AND CONDITIONS")

###### 0. Definitions.[​](#0-definitions "Direct link to 0. Definitions.")

"This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

"Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.

"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees" and "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.

To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.

To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices" to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

###### 1. Source Code.[​](#1-source-code "Direct link to 1. Source Code.")

The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source form of a work. A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.

The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A "Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.

The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.

The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.

###### 2. Basic Permissions.[​](#2-basic-permissions "Direct link to 2. Basic Permissions.")

All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.

###### 3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.[​](#3-protecting-users-legal-rights-from-anti-circumvention-law "Direct link to 3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.")

No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.

When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.

###### 4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.[​](#4-conveying-verbatim-copies "Direct link to 4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.")

You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

###### 5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.[​](#5-conveying-modified-source-versions "Direct link to 5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.")

You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

* a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.

* b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to "keep intact all notices".

* c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

* d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.

A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.

###### 6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.[​](#6-conveying-non-source-forms "Direct link to 6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.")

You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:

* a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.

* b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

* c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.

* d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

* e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.

A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.

A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.

"Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.

If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).

The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.

Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.

###### 7. Additional Terms.[​](#7-additional-terms "Direct link to 7. Additional Terms.")

"Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions. When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

* a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

* b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or

* c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

* d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or

* e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

* f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.

All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further restrictions" within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.

If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.

Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.

###### 8. Termination.[​](#8-termination "Direct link to 8. Termination.")

You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).

However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.

Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.

###### 9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.[​](#9-acceptance-not-required-for-having-copies "Direct link to 9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.")

You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

###### 10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.[​](#10-automatic-licensing-of-downstream-recipients "Direct link to 10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.")

Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

###### 11. Patents.[​](#11-patents "Direct link to 11. Patents.")

A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.

Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.

In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To "grant" such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.

If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. "Knowingly relying" means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.

If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.

A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

###### 12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.[​](#12-no-surrender-of-others-freedom "Direct link to 12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.")

If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

###### 13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.[​](#13-use-with-the-gnu-affero-general-public-license "Direct link to 13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.")

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.

###### 14. Revised Versions of this License.[​](#14-revised-versions-of-this-license "Direct link to 14. Revised Versions of this License.")

The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.

Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.

###### 15. Disclaimer of Warranty.[​](#15-disclaimer-of-warranty "Direct link to 15. Disclaimer of Warranty.")

THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

###### 16. Limitation of Liability.[​](#16-limitation-of-liability "Direct link to 16. Limitation of Liability.")

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

###### 17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.[​](#17-interpretation-of-sections-15-and-16 "Direct link to 17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.")

If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.

#### GNU Lesser General Public License[​](#gnu-lesser-general-public-license "Direct link to GNU Lesser General Public License")

Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <[https://fsf.org/>](https://fsf.org/%3E)

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed. This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.

##### 0. Additional Definitions.[​](#0-additional-definitions "Direct link to 0. Additional Definitions.")

As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

"The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface provided by the Library.

A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with the Library. The particular version of the Library with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked Version".

The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.

The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.

###### 1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.[​](#1-exception-to-section-3-of-the-gnu-gpl "Direct link to 1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.")

You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

###### 2. Conveying Modified Versions.[​](#2-conveying-modified-versions "Direct link to 2. Conveying Modified Versions.")

If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified version:

* a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or

* b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License applicable to that copy.

###### 3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.[​](#3-object-code-incorporating-material-from-library-header-files "Direct link to 3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.")

The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:

* a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.

* b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.

###### 4. Combined Works.[​](#4-combined-works "Direct link to 4. Combined Works.")

You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of the following:

* a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.

* b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.

* c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.

* d) Do one of the following:

  * 0\) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.

  * 1\) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked Version.

* e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is necessary to install and execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)

###### 5. Combined Libraries.[​](#5-combined-libraries "Direct link to 5. Combined Libraries.")

You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by side in a single library together with other library facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:

* a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the terms of this License.

* b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

###### 6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.[​](#6-revised-versions-of-the-gnu-lesser-general-public-license "Direct link to 6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.")

The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that published version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.

### Biometric Readers and Credentials

#### Feature Overview[​](#feature-overview "Direct link to Feature Overview")

BioStar Air now supports biometric readers and biometric credentials for secure access control. Compatible biometric readers, such as BioStation 3 (BS3) and BioEntry W3 (W3), can be registered and configured to authenticate users using facial recognition. The feature supports both single-factor and two-factor authentication, offering enhanced flexibility and security.

#### Navigating to the Feature[​](#navigating-to-the-feature "Direct link to Navigating to the Feature")

* **Register readers**: Use the **BioStar Air app** on your phone, following the same process as you do to register non-biometric readers.

* **Device settings**: Admin Portal → **Device Management** → **Registered Devices** → Click device to edit.

* **User face credential setup**: Admin Portal → **User Management** → **Users** → Add or Edit User → Scroll to **Credential Detail**.

#### Step-by-Step Instructions[​](#step-by-step-instructions "Direct link to Step-by-Step Instructions")

##### Register a Biometric Reader[​](#register-a-biometric-reader "Direct link to Register a Biometric Reader")

1. Ensure the reader (W3 or BS3) has BioStar Air-compatible firmware. If you ordered a device with -AIR at the end of the model name directly from Suprema or an authorized dealer, it will already have the correct firmware.

2. Open the BioStar Air app on your phone and log in using your administrator ID and password.

3. Register the device as you would for any other reader.

Info

For more information about registering devices, refer to [the following](/docs/en/platform/biostar_air/managing-registered-devices#registering-a-new-device).

### BioStar Air Login - Using the Site Selector

#### Overview[​](#overview "Direct link to Overview")

Managing multiple sites on BioStar Air portal used to require a separate email address and password for each site, making the process cumbersome and time-consuming. With the new **Site Selector** feature, you can now use a single email address to manage multiple sites, simplifying the process and reducing the need for multiple logins.

Customers who began using BioStar Air access control before May 2025 may still be using the Airfob Space app, which has since been rebranded as the Suprema Pass app. Both apps offer identical functionality and are fully compatible. There is no need for existing users to switch — mobile credentials work seamlessly across both.

#### What is the Site Selector?[​](#what-is-the-site-selector "Direct link to What is the Site Selector?")

The **Site Selector** feature allows you to log in to the BioStar Air portal using one consolidated email address, even if you’re managing multiple sites. This eliminates the need for different login credentials for each site. Once logged in, you can easily switch between the sites you’re an admin for via the Site Selector menu.

#### How to Use the Site Selector[​](#how-to-use-the-site-selector "Direct link to How to Use the Site Selector")

##### For New Sites[​](#for-new-sites "Direct link to For New Sites")

When creating a new site through the Partner Portal, you can now use an existing email address that you’ve already registered as an admin for another site. The system will automatically link the new site to your existing email, allowing you to manage multiple sites under one account.

**Steps for New Sites**:

* Create a new site through the Partner Portal as you normally would.

* When prompted for an admin email, use an email address that is already associated with another site.

* The new site will automatically be linked to your existing account.

##### For Existing Sites[​](#for-existing-sites "Direct link to For Existing Sites")

If you already manage multiple sites but have separate login credentials for each, you will need to request a manual migration from **Suprema**. This process consolidates your email addresses so that you can manage all sites under a single login.

**Steps for Existing Sites**:

* Contact MOCA support and request a manual migration for your sites.

* If you are using alias addresses like <bob+site1@example.com> and <bob+site2@example.com>, provide the root email address (<bob@example.com>).

* If you are using completely unique addresses for each site, provide a full list of those addresses.

* Once the migration is complete, you will be able to access all your sites with a single email address via the Site Selector.

#### How to Log In and Use the Site Selector[​](#how-to-log-in-and-use-the-site-selector "Direct link to How to Log In and Use the Site Selector")

Once you have a consolidated email address, logging in and switching between sites becomes straightforward:

**Steps to Log In**:

1. **Log in**: Enter your consolidated email address and password as usual.

2. **Select the Site**: Upon logging in, the Site Selector menu will automatically appear, displaying a list of all sites associated with your email address.

3. **Search and Navigate**: If you manage many sites, use the search bar to quickly find the one you’re looking for. Select the site, and you’ll be directed to its dashboard.

#### Additional Notes[​](#additional-notes "Direct link to Additional Notes")

* **Security**: Even though you are using a consolidated email, each site’s permissions and settings remain independent. Admin roles and access rights are unique to each site.

* **Troubleshooting**: If you don’t see the Site Selector or if the wrong sites appear, ensure that your migration request has been completed or contact MOCA support for further assistance.

By simplifying the login process and consolidating your sites under one account, the Site Selector feature saves time and effort while managing multiple sites on BioStar Air.

#### Frequently Asked Questions[​](#frequently-asked-questions "Direct link to Frequently Asked Questions")

<!-- -->

Q.Do I need to switch from Airfob Space to BioStar Air?

No. If you are an existing Airfob Space customer, you can continue using the platform as-is. There is no forced migration at this time.

Q.Will my devices or data be affected?

No. Both platforms share the same backend. Devices, user data, and configurations remain fully compatible across both services.

Q.Should I start using Suprema Pass instead of the Airfob Space app?

There is no need to migrate existing mobile credential users over to BioStar Air. If you use the [app.airfobspace.com](app.airfobspace.com) URL or Airfob Pro app to manage users and issue mobile credentials, those users will receive an invitation that points to the Airfob Space app. If you use [admin.biostarair.com](admin.biostarair.com) or the BioStar Air app to manage users and issue mobile credentials, those users will receive an invitation that points to the Suprema Pass app.

Q.Will support or billing change?

No immediate changes will occur in your support or billing processes. Over time, however, BioStar Air will become the primary brand used for documentation, support, and feature announcements.

Q.Can I switch to BioStar Air if I want to?

Yes. Since the backend is shared, transitioning is simple, but some branding and feature availability differences may apply. Simply start using [admin.biostarair.com](admin.biostarair.com) and the BioStar Air app to manage your site. Existing administrator login credentials from [app.airfobspace.com](app.airfobspace.com) will work seamlessly.

Q.What are the benefits of BioStar Air?

BioStar Air is the future-facing brand. It will receive ongoing enhancements, such as improved integrations, UI/UX updates, and new features that may not be backported to Airfob Space.

Q.Will future features work with Airfob Space?

Some will, but not all. New features may be exclusive to BioStar Air going forward. For the best experience and support, new deployments should use BioStar Air.

### Configuring Time & Attendance (T&A)

#### Feature Overview[​](#feature-overview "Direct link to Feature Overview")

BioStar Air provides basic Time & Attendance (T\&A) tracking by recording shift and break times, which can be exported or integrated with an external T\&A system. While BioStar Air does not offer a full T\&A management system, it supports event logging and API integrations with payroll and attendance systems. It also allows for export of a basic "hours worked" report.

Customers who began using BioStar Air access control before May 2025 may still be using the Airfob Space app, which has since been rebranded as the Suprema Pass app. Both apps offer identical functionality and are fully compatible. There is no need for existing users to switch — mobile credentials work seamlessly across both.

#### How T\&A Works in BioStar Air[​](#how-t-and-a-works "Direct link to How T\&A Works in BioStar Air")

Users can log T\&A events such as:

### Federated Sites

#### Overview[​](#overview "Direct link to Overview")

BioStar Air provides the capability to create **federated sites**, allowing a primary site to manage multiple sub-sites seamlessly. This feature is ideal for multi-tenant buildings or multi-branch organizations, offering centralized control with distributed access management.

#### What Are Federated Sites?[​](#what-are-federated-sites "Direct link to What Are Federated Sites?")

Federated sites enable a hierarchical structure where a **primary site** oversees one or more **sub-sites**. Administrators on the primary site, known as **Federated Admins**, can access and manage sub-sites directly through the BioStar Air interface.

#### Why Use Federated Sites?[​](#why-use-federated-sites "Direct link to Why Use Federated Sites?")

Federated sites are beneficial in the following scenarios:

##### Multi-Tenant Buildings[​](#multi-tenant-buildings "Direct link to Multi-Tenant Buildings")

For example, in a commercial building with different companies occupying each floor, you can establish:

* A **master account** for the building.

* **Sub-accounts** for each tenant company.

This setup ensures only authorized employees access specific floors while simplifying management for the building administrator.

##### Multi-Branch Organizations[​](#multi-branch-organizations "Direct link to Multi-Branch Organizations")

For companies with offices in multiple locations, you can set up:

* A **master account** to manage global settings.

* **Sub-accounts** for each branch.

For instance, a business with 10 offices worldwide can use a federated structure to streamline administration.

#### How to Set Up Federated Sites[​](#how-to-set-up-federated-sites "Direct link to How to Set Up Federated Sites")

##### Access the Partner Portal[​](#access-the-partner-portal "Direct link to Access the Partner Portal")

* The Airfob Partner Portal is exclusively available to partners and installers.

* End customers must contact their installer to configure this feature.

##### Create the Primary Site[​](#create-the-primary-site "Direct link to Create the Primary Site")

1. Log in to the **Partner Portal**.

2. Click **Create Site** and select **Federation Site** under the **Site Profile**.

   * This step **must** be done when setting up a site for the first time.

   * Regular sites cannot be changed into federated sites later.

3. Add **Federated Admins** on the same screen.

   * **Federated Admins** (added in the Partner Portal) have access to the primary site and all sub-sites.

   * **Regular Admins** (added in Airfob Pro) only manage individual sites.

##### Add Sub-Sites[​](#add-sub-sites "Direct link to Add Sub-Sites")

1. Once the primary site is set up as a federated site, the **Site List** will display an option to create sub-sites.

2. Click **Create Sub-Site** and configure it as you would any other site.

#### Important Considerations[​](#important-considerations "Direct link to Important Considerations")

##### User and Reader Management[​](#user-and-reader-management "Direct link to User and Reader Management")

* Users and readers must be added separately to each sub-site.

* Readers can only be registered to one site at a time—either the primary site or a sub-site.

##### Primary Site Usage[​](#primary-site-usage "Direct link to Primary Site Usage")

* Some customers use the primary site solely as an access point for managing sub-sites, without registering users or readers to the primary site.

* **Example 1**: A company with three branch offices sets up a primary site with no devices and creates sub-sites for each branch.

* **Example 2**: A company with a headquarters and three branches registers users and readers at the headquarters (primary site) and sets up sub-sites for the branches.

##### Billing[​](#billing "Direct link to Billing")

* Billing is calculated based on the number of registered devices (readers) per site.

* There is no additional cost for creating a primary site without registered devices.

By utilizing the Federated Sites feature in BioStar Air, administrators can effectively manage access for complex environments, ensuring a secure, scalable, and streamlined experience for all stakeholders.

### IP Camera Support and Configuration

#### Overview[​](#overview "Direct link to Overview")

BioStar Air can automatically detect IP cameras that are connected to the same network as an Airfob Edge Reader. The cameras use the reader as a gateway, eliminating the need for an NVR (Network Video Recorder). Instead, the cameras utilize the built-in SD card storage.

For each Airfob Edge Reader or XPass 2 installed, BioStar Air can show simultaneous live view streams for:

* Up to 2 cameras at Full HD resolution (1080p)

* Up to 4 cameras at HD resolution (720p)

These numbers double when using the XStation 2

#### Compatibility[​](#compatibility "Direct link to Compatibility")

* **Onvif Profiles**: IP cameras must be compatible with Onvif profiles S and/or G.

  * **Onvif Profile S**: Streaming Live Video

  * **Onvif Profile G**: Record Video to an SD Card

* **SD Card**: IP cameras should have an on-board SD card to record video for later playback. (We recommend SanDisk microSDXC Class10 Max Endurance 256GB or 512GB)

* **Encoding**: Cameras must support H.264 (AVC) and it must be enabled as the active CODEC. Airfob Space does not currently support H.265.

* **Recommended Brands**: We have excellent compatibility with Hanwha, Hikvision, and Dahua cameras. Compatibility with other brands may vary depending on their adherence to Onvif profiles.

* **Testing New Cameras**: If you have other camera brands that you would like to test, our team can assist you through the process.

### LinkPass Credentials

#### Feature Overview[​](#feature-overview "Direct link to Feature Overview")

LinkPass is an app-free mobile credential available in BioStar Air. It allows administrators to grant door access to users without requiring any app installation or use of BLE/NFC. LinkPass works entirely through the BioStar Air cloud and is activated via a secure web link, making it ideal for guest access, deliveries, or low-security entry points such as parking gates and lobbies.

#### Navigating to the Feature[​](#navigating-to-the-feature "Direct link to Navigating to the Feature")

To issue a LinkPass credential:

* Log in to the **BioStar Air Admin Portal**

* Navigate to **Users**

* Create a new user or edit an existing user

* Scroll down to the **Card Detail** section

* Enable **Web Card**

* Check the box next to **LinkPass**

#### Step-by-Step Instructions[​](#step-by-step-instructions "Direct link to Step-by-Step Instructions")

1. Sign in to the **BioStar Air Admin Portal**.

2. Go to the **Users** tab and select an existing user or click **+ Add User** to create a new one.

3. In the user detail view, scroll to the **Card Detail** section.

4. Enable the **Web Card** option.

5. Check the box next to **LinkPass**.

6. Assign a valid **email address or phone number** to the user to ensure they receive the credential link.

7. Assign appropriate **access levels** and set the **validity period** for the user.

8. Click **Save** to issue the credential.

9. The user will receive an invitation via email or SMS with a unique LinkPass URL.

#### How Users Use LinkPass[​](#how-users-use-linkpass "Direct link to How Users Use LinkPass")

1. The user opens the LinkPass URL from the message they received.

2. A webpage displays all doors assigned to them, each with an **Open** button.

3. Clicking **Open** sends a cloud-based unlock command to the reader—no BLE or NFC is needed.

#### Common Issues & Considerations[​](#common-issues-and-considerations "Direct link to Common Issues & Considerations")

* **Credential Scope**: LinkPass credentials allow access to the same doors as any other credential assigned to the user. For this reason, **do not issue LinkPass credentials to users with access to secure areas**.

* **No App Required**: LinkPass operates via a web browser—no mobile app, Bluetooth, or NFC is required.

* **Cloud-Based Access**: LinkPass commands are transmitted through the BioStar Air cloud and can be activated from anywhere with internet access. There is no geofencing.

* **Reader Connectivity**: Door readers must be online and connected to BioStar Air for LinkPass to function correctly.

* **Use Case Recommendation**: LinkPass is best suited for temporary visitors, deliveries, and low-security areas like lobbies or parking gates.

### Why Do I Need to Enable Location Services?

#### Feature Overview[​](#feature-overview "Direct link to Feature Overview")

The Suprema Pass app requires location services to function correctly with your smartphone’s mobile access card. This ensures secure Bluetooth communication between your phone and the access control device.

Customers who began using BioStar Air access control before May 2025 may still be using the Airfob Space app, which has since been rebranded as the Suprema Pass app. Both apps offer identical functionality and are fully compatible. There is no need for existing users to switch — mobile credentials work seamlessly across both.

<!-- -->

Q.Why Am I Being Asked to Enable Location Services?

The Suprema Pass app communicates with access control devices using Bluetooth. On Android devices, enabling location services is required by the operating system for Bluetooth functionality. On iOS, location permissions are necessary for using the app in background mode.

Q.Does the Airfob App Store My Location Data?

**No**. The Suprema Pass app does not track or store GPS-based location data, nor does it share this data with third parties.While the app uses Bluetooth location services for authentication, access logs are only recorded in the site administrator portal. The Suprema Pass app, Suprema, and MOCA System do not store or use any personal location data.

Q.Will Enabling Location Services Drain My Phone's Battery?

**No**. Unlike other apps that use GPS, the Suprema Pass app does not rely on GPS location services, so it does not increase battery consumption.

Q.Am I Required to Enable Location Services to Use the Suprema Pass?

* **Android users**: Yes, location services must be enabled due to Android’s Bluetooth policy.
* **iOS users**: Required only for background mode. If using the "Only while app on screen" mode, location permissions are not needed.

Q.Location Permission Requirements by Connection Method:

* **Only while app on screen**: Location permission can be set to "Allow only while using the app." (Not required on iOS.)
* **Background mode (Always)**: Location permission must be set to "Always allow."
* **NFC Mode**: Android users must agree to location permissions.

Q.Why Does My Phone Randomly Ask Me to Agree to Location Services?

1. If you select "Don't Allow" or "Allow Once," your phone may continue prompting you to enable location services. This is controlled by iOS or Android, not by the Suprema Pass app.
2. For iOS users, even if "Always Allow" is selected, Apple may still display periodic confirmation messages as part of its security policies. Please continue to click "Always Allow" or mobile credentials may not work consistently. Features like Background Mode and Long Press may be disabled randomly.

### Managing Door & Device Groups

#### Feature Overview[​](#feature-overview "Direct link to Feature Overview")

Door groups and device groups in BioStar Air provide a structured way to organize site devices and access points. Grouping devices and doors simplifies access level configuration and system management.

Customers who began using BioStar Air access control before May 2025 may still be using the Airfob Space app, which has since been rebranded as the Suprema Pass app. Both apps offer identical functionality and are fully compatible. There is no need for existing users to switch — mobile credentials work seamlessly across both.

#### Navigating to Device Groups[​](#navigating-to-device-groups "Direct link to Navigating to Device Groups")

To manage device groups:

1. Go to **Device Management** in the BioStar Air Portal.

2. Click on **Device Groups** to view the existing groups.

#### Creating a Device Group[​](#creating-a-device-group "Direct link to Creating a Device Group")

To create a new device group:

1. Click on **Add Device Group**.

3. Select the devices to be included in this group.

4. Click **OK** to save.

#### Creating a Subgroup[​](#creating-a-subgroup "Direct link to Creating a Subgroup")

Device groups can have subgroups for further organization. However, groups are **not hierarchical**, meaning devices in a subgroup are not automatically included in the parent group.

1. Click **Subgroup** under Device Groups.

2. Select a parent group (e.g., "Readers").

3. Enter a subgroup name (e.g., "BioStar Air Readers").

4. Select the devices to be included.

5. Click **OK** to save.

#### Assigning Devices to Multiple Groups[​](#assigning-devices-to-multiple-groups "Direct link to Assigning Devices to Multiple Groups")

Devices can belong to more than one group. To add devices to additional groups:

1. Go to **Registered Devices**.

2. Select the devices you want to assign.

3. Click **Manage Groups**.

4. Choose additional groups and confirm.

Assigned groups will be displayed in the device list.

#### Navigating to Door Groups[​](#navigating-to-door-groups "Direct link to Navigating to Door Groups")

#### Creating a Door Group[​](#creating-a-door-group "Direct link to Creating a Door Group")

To create a new door group:

1. Click **Add Door Group**.

2. Enter a group name (e.g., "Interior Doors").

3. Select the doors to be included.

4. Click **OK** to save.

#### Creating a Door Group Subgroup[​](#creating-a-door-group-subgroup "Direct link to Creating a Door Group Subgroup")

Door groups can have subgroups, but like device groups, they are **not hierarchical**. Adding a door to a subgroup does not automatically include it in the parent group.

1. Click **Add Subgroup** under Door Groups.

2. Select a parent group (e.g., "Interior Doors").

3. Enter a subgroup name (e.g., "Trap Doors").

4. Select the doors to be included.

5. Click **OK** to save.

#### Key Considerations[​](#key-considerations "Direct link to Key Considerations")

##### Device & Door Group Hierarchy[​](#device-and-door-group-hierarchy "Direct link to Device & Door Group Hierarchy")

* Adding a door or device to a subgroup does not automatically add it to the parent group.

* If assigning groups to access levels, ensure that you add the **specific subgroup** needed rather than just the parent group.

##### Group Organization[​](#group-organization "Direct link to Group Organization")

* It is possible to create empty parent groups without any devices or doors.

* Filtering options allow viewing devices and doors by group.

#### Can one device belong to multiple device groups?[​](#can-one-device-belong-to-multiple-device-groups "Direct link to Can one device belong to multiple device groups?")

**Yes**. In BioStar Air, a single device can be assigned to **multiple device groups** without limitation.

This differs from BioStar 2, where device grouping was more rigid. In BioStar Air, flexible grouping enables better filtering, monitoring, and access control configurations:

* Use logical groupings like "Exterior Devices" or "Biometric Readers" to organize devices by location or type.

* Device groups can be used to **filter Event Logs**, **create Reports**, or **filter the Devices screen** for easier troubleshooting or reporting.

* For **muster point** configuration, devices (not doors) are assigned. Using device groups helps ensure users are marked safe **only** when they use designated exit readers.

### Managing User Groups

#### Feature Overview[​](#feature-overview "Direct link to Feature Overview")

User groups in BioStar Air allow administrators to categorize users based on departments, roles, or other classifications. This helps in organizing and managing access control more efficiently.

Customers who began using BioStar Air access control before May 2025 may still be using the Airfob Space app, which has since been rebranded as the Suprema Pass app. Both apps offer identical functionality and are fully compatible. There is no need for existing users to switch — mobile credentials work seamlessly across both.

#### Navigating to User Groups[​](#navigating-to-user-groups "Direct link to Navigating to User Groups")

To manage user groups:

1. Go to **User Management** in the BioStar Air Portal.

2. Click on **User Groups** to view existing groups.

3. Here, you can **add**, **edit**, or **delete** user groups.

#### Creating a User Group[​](#creating-a-user-group "Direct link to Creating a User Group")

To create a new user group:

1. Click on **Add User Group**.

2. Enter a name for the group (e.g., "Law Team").

3. Click **OK** to create the group.

#### Assigning Users to a Group[​](#assigning-users-to-a-group "Direct link to Assigning Users to a Group")

Once a user group is created, users can be added by:

1. Going to **Users** under **User Management**.

2. Selecting the users to be assigned.

3. Clicking on **Manage Group**.

4. Choosing the user group and confirming by clicking **OK**.

Returning to the **User Groups** interface will reflect the updated total number of users in each group.

#### Creating Subgroups[​](#creating-subgroups "Direct link to Creating Subgroups")

Subgroups allow further categorization within a user group. However, subgroups are **not hierarchical**, meaning users in a subgroup are not automatically included in the parent group.

##### To create a subgroup:[​](#to-create-a-subgroup: "Direct link to To create a subgroup:")

1. Select the parent group.

2. Click **Add Subgroup** and enter a name (e.g., "Civil Law Team").

3. Click **OK** to create the subgroup.

##### Assigning Users to a Subgroup:[​](#assigning-users-to-a-subgroup: "Direct link to Assigning Users to a Subgroup:")

1. Go to **Users** under **User Management**.

2. Select the users to be added.

3. Click **Manage Group**.

4. Select the subgroup under its parent group and click **OK**.

#### Understanding User Group Totals[​](#understanding-user-group-totals "Direct link to Understanding User Group Totals")

Since user groups are not hierarchical:

* Users in a subgroup do **not** automatically appear in the parent group.

* The total user count for a parent group does not include subgroup members unless manually added.

* Selecting a subgroup will only display users assigned specifically to that subgroup.

#### Can a user belong to multiple user groups?[​](#can-a-user-belong-to-multiple-user-groups "Direct link to Can a user belong to multiple user groups?")

**Yes**. Users in BioStar Air can be members of **multiple user groups**.

In BioStar 2, user groups were typically tied to a single department. BioStar Air decouples this, allowing more dynamic usage:

* Filter the user list by group (e.g., "HR Department") to quickly manage access levels.

* Create context-specific groups (e.g., "Men's Locker Room") that cut across departments.

* Use user groups in **event log filters** and **report generation**.

* Assign user groups to **muster point** devices or device groups for targeted safety protocols.

This flexibility makes it easier to manage overlapping user roles and access scenarios.

### BioStar Air 2.11 - Release Highlights

November 25, 2025

BioStar Air 2.11 continues our commitment to making cloud access control more reliable than traditional on-premise systems. This release introduces major improvements to offline behavior, updates to the admin experience, and powerful new capabilities for BioStation 3.

Whether you're managing a single site or dozens of locations, this update makes BioStar Air easier to use, more resilient, and ready for more complex deployments.

***

#### RFID Card Active Sync on XPass 2 and XStation 2[​](#rfid-card-active-sync-on-xpass-2-and-xstation-2 "Direct link to RFID Card Active Sync on XPass 2 and XStation 2")

As part of our long-term goal to exceed the reliability of on-premise access control, we’ve fully re-engineered how BioStar Air handles credential redundancy. With the new **Active Sync** architecture, readers continue working normally even when disconnected from the network.

All primary credential types remain fully functional during network outages:

* **RF Cards**

* **Biometric Templates**

* **Mobile Credentials**

* **PINs**

**You'll still need a network connection to use Dynamic QR and LinkPass Credentials**.

Readers still plug in and sync automatically, with no new installation steps. Credential data is continuously synchronized in the background.

This feature is being rolled out by device type:

* **BioStation 3 / BioEntry W3**

  Available now. No firmware update required.

* **XPass 2**

  Rolling out beginning **Nov 25, 2025**.

  If firmware v2.11 is not visible yet, please be patient. All customers will receive it by **Dec 9**.

* **XStation 2**

  Scheduled for release on **Dec 23, 2025**.

***

#### Interface Updates[​](#interface-updates "Direct link to Interface Updates")

We've made several UI enhancements to simplify everyday administration and reduce repetitive actions.

##### Device List[​](#device-list "Direct link to Device List")

* Added a **Refresh Status**() button for situations where the displayed status may be out of date.

* You can now **delete devices directly from the web portal** without using the mobile app. *Note: Devices must have an active network connection or they will still need to be deleted with the mobile app. Supported on the same schedule as firmware updates listed above.*

##### Personal Information Masking[​](#personal-information-masking "Direct link to Personal Information Masking")

A new **Mask Personal Information** button hides sensitive user details while viewing event logs, admin logs, or user information on-screen. Helpful for audits or shared-screen reviews.

##### Reports[​](#reports "Direct link to Reports")

All dropdown filters are now **searchable**, making it easier to build report templates quickly.

##### User List[​](#user-list "Direct link to User List")

Improved the user-selection UI. Admins now see a **visual count of selected users** before performing batch actions.

##### Partner Portal[​](#partner-portal "Direct link to Partner Portal")

* Improved **user and device counts**.

* Improved **site deletion workflow** warns you if devices are still registered to the site.

***

#### BioStation 3 – Video Gateway Support[​](#biostation-3--video-gateway-support "Direct link to BioStation 3 – Video Gateway Support")

BioStation 3 can now operate as a **video gateway**, allowing it to process and relay video streams from multiple 4K cameras simultaneously. This gives sites a powerful and flexible way to deploy video without additional hardware.

To enable:

1. Update your BioStation 3 firmware.

2. Open Device Settings for your BioStation 3.

3. Toggle **Video Gateway** on.

***

#### Event Logs & Alerts[​](#event-logs--alerts "Direct link to Event Logs & Alerts")

Previously, some network-disconnection logs were stored on the device and only uploaded once the reader reconnected. This caused delays in alert visibility.

With v2.11:

* **Network disconnection events are now generated server-side**

* Alerts appear immediately when a reader loses connectivity

* Admins can respond more quickly to wiring issues, outages, or unexpected device behavior

This ensures consistent, real-time awareness, even when devices go offline.

### Sensitivity Settings

#### Feature Overview[​](#feature-overview "Direct link to Feature Overview")

The **Sensitivity Setting** feature allows users to adjust the Bluetooth recognition sensitivity between their smartphone and the Airfob device. This customization helps ensure smoother authentication, reducing unwanted access attempts or authentication failures.

Customers who began using BioStar Air access control before May 2025 may still be using the Airfob Space app, which has since been rebranded as the Suprema Pass app. Both apps offer identical functionality and are fully compatible. There is no need for existing users to switch — mobile credentials work seamlessly across both.

Since different smartphone models have varying Bluetooth signal strengths, users may experience different recognition distances. Additionally, environmental factors such as walls, interference, or the placement of the Airfob device can impact Bluetooth recognition.

#### How to Adjust the Sensitivity Setting[​](#how-to-adjust-the-sensitivity-setting "Direct link to How to Adjust the Sensitivity Setting")

Users can fine-tune Bluetooth authentication sensitivity based on their smartphone's Bluetooth strength and personal preference.

1. Open the **Suprema Pass** app.

2. Tap the **≡** (hamburger) icon in the top-right corner of the screen.

3. From the menu, select **Sensitivity Setting**.

4. Adjust the sensitivity by moving the **green circle** on the scale:

   * **Near**: Lowers sensitivity to prevent unintended authentication (e.g., if your phone unlocks doors when on your desk).

   * **Far**: Increases sensitivity if authentication fails unless the phone is extremely close to the reader.

#### Tips for iOS Users[​](#tips-for-ios-users "Direct link to Tips for iOS Users")

If you use Apple Pay, you may notice that it launches when bringing your iPhone close to an Airfob device. This occurs because the NFC area of the phone is detected alongside the Airfob mobile card authentication.

**Solution**: Adjusting the sensitivity setting to **Far** allows the Airfob device to recognize the phone's Bluetooth signal earlier, reducing the need to physically touch the reader. This prevents Apple Pay from triggering while still allowing seamless door access.

From v2.10, BioStar Air returns a validation report if an admin uploads a CSV file with invalid entries. After correcting the errors, re-upload the file.

#### Preparing Your CSV File[​](#preparing-your-csv-file "Direct link to Preparing Your CSV File")

##### Use the Exact Format of the CSV Template[​](#use-the-exact-format-of-the-csv-template "Direct link to Use the Exact Format of the CSV Template")

* Download the template from the Admin Portal:

  **User Management** → **Users** → **+ Add User** → **Import Users** → **Download**

* **Do not add or delete columns manually**. The system will reject the file if unexpected columns are present.

* If you need to include additional fields like Employee ID or Department, go to **User Template Settings** and add these fields there. Once added, they will appear automatically in the downloaded CSV file.

##### User Key (User ID)[​](#user-key-user-id "Direct link to User Key (User ID)")

* This is the unique numeric ID for each user.

* You may **leave this column blank** and the system will assign values automatically.

* If you choose to populate it yourself:

  * The value must be **numeric only**

  * The value must be **unique**

  * **Do not include letters, spaces, hyphens, or special characters**

**Important**

If you’re trying to insert a company-specific employee ID (which often contains letters), **do not use the User Key field**. Instead, create a custom field for this purpose using **User Template Settings**.

##### Email Address[​](#email-address "Direct link to Email Address")

* Must follow a valid email format (see validation formula below).

  * No spaces

  * Contains `@`

  * Domain includes a `.` and the top-level domain (example.com, gmail.com, suprema.co.kr)

  * No extra periods after the address.

  * No special or hidden characters

  * Must be an email address. (We have seen instance of "Did not provide" or "Not Provided".)

* Must be **unique** — no duplicates allowed within the file or among existing users.

* Required if the user will be issued:

  * Mobile credential

  * LinkPass

  * QR code credential

* Not required if the user only has an RFID card.

##### Phone Number[​](#phone-number "Direct link to Phone Number")

* Optional unless used for credential delivery via SMS.

* Must be **unique**, just like email addresses — no duplicates within the file or with existing users.

* Email is preferred for credential delivery since SMS messages incur an additional charge.

##### Date Fields[​](#date-fields "Direct link to Date Fields")

All date fields (such as Issue Date or Expiration Date) must follow this exact format:

```
YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.sssZ

Example:
1995-05-09T00:00:00.000Z
```

Even small differences — such as a missing "Z", using slashes instead of dashes, or omitting the time — will cause the upload to fail.

##### Credential Requirements[​](#credential-requirements "Direct link to Credential Requirements")

| Credential Type        | Email or Phone Required? |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------ |
| RFID Only              | No                       |
| Mobile / LinkPass / QR | Yes - one is required    |

* Credentials must be delivered to either an email address or a phone number.

* You can provide both, but **at least one is required** for mobile-type credentials.

* Email is free. SMS is billed.

#### Excel Formulas for Pre-Validation[​](#excel-formulas "Direct link to Excel Formulas for Pre-Validation")

We strongly recommend using the following formulas in **helper columns** to check your data before uploading.

Detect Duplicate Emails or Phone Numbers

```
=IF(E2="", "", IF(COUNTIF(E$2:E2, E2)>1, "Duplicate", "First Occurrence"))
```

Validate ISO 8601 Date Format (Column Q)

```
=IF(Q2="", "", IF(AND(LEN(Q2)=24, 
  ISNUMBER(VALUE(MID(Q2,1,4))), MID(Q2,5,1)="-", 
  ISNUMBER(VALUE(MID(Q2,6,2))), MID(Q2,8,1)="-", 
  ISNUMBER(VALUE(MID(Q2,9,2))), MID(Q2,11,1)="T", 
  ISNUMBER(VALUE(MID(Q2,12,2))), MID(Q2,14,1)=":", 
  ISNUMBER(VALUE(MID(Q2,15,2))), MID(Q2,17,1)=":", 
  ISNUMBER(VALUE(MID(Q2,18,2))), MID(Q2,20,1)=".", 
  ISNUMBER(VALUE(MID(Q2,21,3))), RIGHT(Q2,1)="Z"), 
  "Valid", "Invalid"))
```

Validate Email Format (Column E)

```
=IF(TRIM(E2)="", "", IF(AND(
  ISNUMBER(FIND("@", E2)),
  ISNUMBER(FIND(".", E2)),
  FIND("@", E2) > 1,
  FIND(".", E2, FIND("@", E2)) > FIND("@", E2) + 1,
  LEN(E2) - LEN(SUBSTITUTE(E2, "@", "")) = 1,
  ISERROR(FIND(" ", E2))
), "Valid", "Invalid"))
```

#### Upload Errors? Here’s What to Check[​](#common-errors "Direct link to Upload Errors? Here’s What to Check")

* Did you download the correct template and avoid adding extra columns?

* Are all required fields filled in for users receiving mobile credentials?

* Are email addresses and phone numbers unique across both the file and your existing users?

* Are date and email formats exactly as specified above?

**Please note**

We do not offer file correction services. If your file does not upload, use the validation tools above to identify and fix the issue.

This guide is intended to help you complete the upload successfully without manual troubleshooting from our team.

### User Card and Credential Types

#### Feature Overview[​](#feature-overview "Direct link to Feature Overview")

Starting from BioStar Air version 2.6, two distinct user types have been introduced to improve user management:

* **Regular Users**: Long-term users with permanent credentials, including mobile, RFID, facial authentication, and PIN options.

* **Temporary Users**: Guests who receive temporary web-based credentials.

Customers who began using BioStar Air access control before May 2025 may still be using the Airfob Space app, which has since been rebranded as the Suprema Pass app. Both apps offer identical functionality and are fully compatible. There is no need for existing users to switch — mobile credentials work seamlessly across both.

#### Regular User Card Types[​](#regular-user-card-typs "Direct link to Regular User Card Types")

Regular users can be issued the following credentials:

##### Mobile Card[​](#mobile-card "Direct link to Mobile Card")

* A unique **Card ID** is automatically assigned but can be manually set.

* If using **Airfob Tag** or **Airfob Patch**, the mobile card number can be used as a card serial number to integrate with an existing access control system.

* For compatibility with previous systems, the mobile card ID can match the RF card number from an older site.

##### QR Code[​](#qr-code "Direct link to QR Code")

* Regular users can access a **QR code** within their mobile card.

* The QR code is accessible by pressing a button on the mobile card interface.

##### RF Card[​](#rf-card "Direct link to RF Card")

* Add up to 8 RFID cards per user.

* Configure the **Card Type** (CSN or Wiegand), **Card ID number**, and **Card Name** to simplify management when multiple cards are assigned.

* You can scan an existing RFID card using a connected Suprema reader by clicking **Scan with Reader** and selecting the reader.

* For existing RF cards with a **CSN** (Card Serial Number), the CSN can be entered manually.

##### Face[​](#face "Direct link to Face")

* Add up to two face profile images for a user.

* Enroll via a connected reader, upload an existing image, or send a link by email for self-enrollment using the phone's selfie camera.

##### PIN[​](#pin "Direct link to PIN")

Set a 4–16 digit PIN to use as part of two-factor authentication (2FA).

#### Temporary User Card Types[​](#temporary-user-card-typs "Direct link to Temporary User Card Types")

Temporary users do not receive mobile or RFID cards. Instead, they are issued **web-based credentials** that do not require an app download. The available options are:

##### Web QR Code[​](#web-qr-code "Direct link to Web QR Code")

* Delivered via email or text message.

* Accessible through a web browser.

* Uses a **dynamic QR code** that updates every five minutes for enhanced security.

### Checking if a Camera Supports Recorded Video Playback

#### Troubleshooting Tips for Video Playback Issues[​](#troubleshooting-tips-for-video-playback-issues "Direct link to Troubleshooting Tips for Video Playback Issues")

If recorded videos do not play after registering the camera in BioStar Air, follow these steps to diagnose and resolve the issue:

##### Verify ONVIF Profile G Support[​](#verify-onvif-profile-g-support "Direct link to Verify ONVIF Profile G Support")

Check whether the camera supports ONVIF Profile G by searching for the model name on [ONVIF's conformant products page](https://www.onvif.org). ONVIF Profile G is required for recorded video playback.

##### Test Video Playback in Camera Settings[​](#test-video-playback-in-camera-settings "Direct link to Test Video Playback in Camera Settings")

* Log into the camera’s settings via its web interface.

* Ensure that you can view the live camera feed and recorded videos.

* Be aware that some cameras may restrict simultaneous playback of recorded videos in both the portal and the settings menu. If playback works in the camera settings but not in BioStar Air, try closing the settings interface and testing again.

##### Check Video Codec Compatibility[​](#check-video-codec-compatibility "Direct link to Check Video Codec Compatibility")

Ensure that the recorded video is using the **H.264** codec, as BioStar Air does not support H.265.

##### Format the SD Card If Codec Was Changed[​](#format-the-sd-card-if-codec-was-changed "Direct link to Format the SD Card If Codec Was Changed")

If the video codec was changed at any point, the existing recordings may not play correctly. Formatting the SD card may be necessary for the new settings to take effect. This solution has been confirmed to resolve playback issues on some camera models.

##### Reference ONVIF's Conformant Products List[​](#reference-onvifs-conformant-products-list "Direct link to Reference ONVIF's Conformant Products List")

If you are unsure whether your camera meets ONVIF standards, visit the [ONVIF website](https://www.onvif.org) to verify compatibility.

By following these steps, you can troubleshoot video playback issues and ensure proper functionality within BioStar Air.

### E200 QR Scanner - Wiring and Configuration

#### Step 1: Wiring[​](#wiring "Direct link to Step 1: Wiring")

Wire the E200 series QR scanner using the included adapter cable, as shown below.

* The green terminal block has pins labeled **1 to 4**, **right to left** (when facing the front of the connector).

  This is the opposite of many other connectors—double-check orientation before wiring.\_

  | Pin | Wire Color            | Function          |
  | --- | --------------------- | ----------------- |
  | 1   | Black                 | Negative / Ground |
  | 2   | Red                   | Positive (V+)     |
  | 3   | Yellow (white stripe) | RS-485 TRXN       |
  | 4   | Blue (white stripe)   | RS-485 TRXP       |

* Connect the white 4-pin pin-and-socket connector to the **CON**port on the bottom of the QR scanner. This connector is **polarized** (with a groove), so it only fits in one direction.

  ![](/docs/en/img/air/air-hardware-qr-reader-diagram.png)

#### Step 2: Enable QR Reader[​](#enable-qr-reader "Direct link to Step 2: Enable QR Reader")

In the **BioStar Air** admin portal (web or app), navigate to:

**Device Management** → **Devices** → click or tap the device with the E200 QR scanner connected.

* Under **Details**, find the **QR Reader** option.

* Click or tap the toggle switch to turn it **on**. Refer to the image on the right.

Enabling the QR reader disables the use of other RS-485-connected devices (e.g., SIO2) on the same reader.

![](/docs/en/img/air/air-hardware-edit-device-qr-reader.jpg)

#### Step 3: Configure the QR Scanner[​](#configure-qr-scanner "Direct link to Step 3: Configure the QR Scanner")

By default, the **E200 QR scanner** is set to a baud rate of **115,200**.

To use it with **Suprema readers**, you must change the baud rate to **9,600**.

* After connecting the QR scanner to the reader, **scan the barcode below** to apply the new baud rate.

![](/docs/en/img/air/air-hardware-qr-reader-barcode.png)

**That’s it!**

As long as your wiring is correct and your Suprema reader has an active network connection, you’ll be able to use **dynamic QR credentials** provisioned through BioStar Air.

### Add Auxiliary Database

When adding a communication server, add and connect an auxiliary database to reduce the load on the main server.

Info

* You need a **multi-communication server** license to add an auxiliary database. For more information on licensing policy, refer to [the following](/docs/en/platform/biostar_x/licensing#features-add-ons).

* For more information on installing a communication server, refer to [the following](/docs/en/platform/biostar_x/install-communication-server).

#### Before start[​](#before-start "Direct link to Before start")

If you are using a domain or hostname instead of an IP address for communication between databases in a MariaDB environment, be sure to check the following guidance.

* If you do not use an IP address, `Create user` or `Grant` enrollment may not be possible.

* If you are communicating using a domain or hostname, ensure that user and permissions are registered for localhost.

* If you installed BioStar X using the convenient installation method, the root account is registered only for localhost, so you must add the server's IP address or *127.0.0.1*.

##### Registration method[​](#registration-method "Direct link to Registration method")

Check if a password is set for the account with Host *127.0.0.1* and User root; if not set, be sure to establish a password and grant permissions.

1. Check if a password is set for the account with Host *127.0.0.1* and User root.

   ```
   SELECT * FROM mysql.user;
   ```

   ![](/docs/en/img/common/biostarx-subdb-mariadb-specific.png)

   If blank, the password is not set, so be sure to run the query in the following items to add a password and grant permissions.

2. Set a password and grant permissions for the account with Host *127.0.0.1* and User root.

   ```
   ALTER USER 'root'@'127.0.0.1' IDENTIFIED BY '<Main DB AC Schema Password>';
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'root'@'127.0.0.1';
     
   CREATE USER '<Main DB AC User>'@'127.0.0.1' IDENTIFIED BY '<Main DB AC Schema Password>';
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO '<Main DB AC User>'@'127.0.0.1';
   CREATE USER '<Main DB AC User>'@'::1' IDENTIFIED BY '<Main DB AC Schema Password>';
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO '<Main DB AC User>'@'::1';
     
   CREATE USER '<Main DB TA User>'@'127.0.0.1' IDENTIFIED BY '<Main DB AC Schema Password>';
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO '<Main DB TA User>'@'127.0.0.1';
   CREATE USER '<Main DB TA User>'@'::1' IDENTIFIED BY '<Main DB AC Schema Password>';
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO '<Main DB TA User>'@'::1';
     
   CREATE USER '<Main DB VE User>'@'127.0.0.1' IDENTIFIED BY '<Main DB AC Schema Password>';
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO '<Main DB VE User>'@'127.0.0.1';
   CREATE USER '<Main DB VE User>'@'::1' IDENTIFIED BY '<Main DB AC Schema Password>';
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO '<Main DB VE User>'@'::1';
     
   FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
   ```

   Example

   ```
   ALTER USER 'root'@'127.0.0.1' IDENTIFIED BY 'admin1234!';
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'root'@'127.0.0.1';
   FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
   ```

##### IP address communication settings[​](#ip-address-communication-settings "Direct link to IP address communication settings")

The following settings can force communication via IP address.

1. After installing **BioStar X**, move to the following path.

   > C:\Program Files\BioStar X\ta\mariadb-11.4.4-winx64

2. Open the *my.cnf* file with the owner's permissions and add the `skip-name-resolve` option to the \[mysqld] section.

   ```
   [mysqld]
   port = 3312
   character-set-server=utf8
   collation-server=utf8_unicode_ci
   socket = /tmp/mysql.sock
   skip-external-locking
   key_buffer_size = 32M
   max_allowed_packet = 64M
   ...
   skip-name-resolve
   ```

3. Restart the MariaDB service.

#### Add auxiliary database[​](#add-sub-db "Direct link to Add auxiliary database")

This section provides guidance on adding an auxiliary database. Depending on the type of database being used, there are two methods: MariaDB and SQL Server.

##### MariaDB[​](#mariadb "Direct link to MariaDB")

###### Main database[​](#main-database "Direct link to Main database")

Grant the account and permissions to access the main database from the new auxiliary database.

```
CREATE USER '<Main DB AC Schema User>'@'<Sub DB IP>' IDENTIFIED BY '<Main DB AC Schema Password>';

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON <Main DB AC Schema>.* TO '<Main DB AC Schema User>'@'<Sub DB IP>';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

Example

```
CREATE USER 'biostarx_ac_user'@'192.168.12.42' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON biostar2_ac.* TO 'biostarx_ac_user'@'192.168.12.42';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

###### Auxiliary database[​](#auxiliary-database "Direct link to Auxiliary database")

Grant the account and permissions to access the new auxiliary database from the main database.

```
CREATE USER '<Sub DB AC Schema User>'@'<Main DB IP>' IDENTIFIED BY '<Sub DB AC Schema Password>';

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON <Sub DB AC Schema>.* TO '<Sub DB AC Schema User>'@'<Main DB IP>';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

Example

```
CREATE USER 'biostarx_ac_user'@'192.168.12.161' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON biostar2_ac.* TO 'biostarx_ac_user'@'192.168.12.161';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

###### Check for FederatedX usage[​](#check-for-federatedx-usage "Direct link to Check for FederatedX usage")

Run the command below in both the main and auxiliary databases to check if the FederatedX storage engine is enabled.

```
SHOW ENGINES;
```

If the query result shows `Engine : FEDERATED, Support : YES`, it is already installed. If the FederatedX storage engine is not installed, execute the query below.

```
INSTALL PLUGIN federated SONAME 'ha_federatedx';
```

Info

Check if the *ha\_federatedx.dll* file exists in the *lib/plugin* folder under the path where MariaDB is installed. Typically, the dll file exists at *C:\Program Files\MariaDB {version}\lib\plugin* path.

###### Register server alias[​](#register-server-alias "Direct link to Register server alias")

Register a server alias to allow the federatedX table created in the auxiliary database to access the source table in the main database.

```
CREATE SERVER 'default' FOREIGN DATA WRAPPER mysql OPTIONS (HOST '<Main DB IP>', PORT <Main DB PORT>, DATABASE '<Main DB AC Schema>', USER '<Main DB AC USER>', PASSWORD '<Main DB AC USER Password>');

-- Confirm registration
SELECT * FROM mysql.servers;
```

If you need to change information about Host, Port, DB, User, or Password for the existing registered server name, it can be modified using the `Alter` statement. You may also change certain information only.

```
ALTER SERVER 'default' OPTIONS (HOST '<Main DB IP>', PORT <Main DB PORT>, DATABASE '<Main DB AC Schema>', USER '<Main DB AC USER>', PASSWORD '<Main DB AC USER Password>');
```

Example

```
CREATE SERVER 'default' FOREIGN DATA WRAPPER mysql OPTIONS (HOST '192.168.12.161', PORT 3312, DATABASE 'biostar2_ac', USER 'biostarx_ac_user', PASSWORD 'password');
  
ALTER SERVER 'default' OPTIONS (HOST '192.168.12.161', PORT 3312, DATABASE 'biostar2_ac', USER 'biostarx_ac_usermt__fttid__', PASSWORD 'password');
```

###### Table link settings[​](#table-link-settings "Direct link to Table link settings")

Follow the steps below to link the necessary tables in the auxiliary database to the tables in the main database.

* The following is the query to generate `CREATE TABLE` statements in the main database.

  ```
  select
    concat(
        'CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS <SubDB_AC_Database_Schema>.', table_name,
        ' ENGINE=FEDERATED ',
        'CONNECTION=''default/', table_name, ''';'
    ) as create_table_sql
  from information_schema.TABLES
  where TABLE_SCHEMA = '<MainDB_AC_Database_Schema>'
      AND TABLE_TYPE = 'BASE TABLE'
      AND NOT TABLE_NAME REGEXP '^t_lg[0-9]{6}$'
      AND NOT TABLE_NAME REGEXP '^t_almevt[0-9]{6}$'
      AND NOT TABLE_NAME REGEXP '^t_lgalmtrstrc[0-9]{6}$'
  ORDER BY TABLE_NAME;
  ```

  Info

  Due to the nature of FederatedX, it is recommended to set `Table_type` to 'BASE TABLE'. `VIEW type` is also possible but not recommended.

- Be sure to input the `CREATE` statement generated by the above query into the auxiliary database.

### Enter Basic User Information

This section describes how to enter basic user information. The entered user information is used for search and management. Managing user information clearly helps comply with the organization's security and privacy policies.

* When you systematically enter basic information such as name, department, position, and group, you can easily search for, classify, and manage users.

* You can refine the access rights based on the user's affiliation, position, and group information.

* It is advantageous for security and auditing because it allows for accurate tracking of activities, access logs, etc. by user.

Go to the Launcher → User page. You can enter user information in the two ways below.

<!-- -->

* **New User**: Click the New User button at the top right of the screen. The New User window appears.

* **Existing User**: Double-click a user in the user list. Or, click the user and click the See More button in the preview screen displayed on the right side of the screen. A window for editing user information appears.

The fields that can be set in the Information section are as follows. Please enter user information by referring to the description for each field.

![](/docs/en/img/en/biostarx-new-user-information.png)

* **Photo**: Register the user's photo. You can take a photo with the webcam or upload a photo from your PC. When you hover over the profile, the tools available will be displayed.

  ![](/docs/en/img/common/biostarx-new-user-photo.png)

  * : If a webcam is connected to the PC, you can click the button to take and register a photo.

  * : You can upload an image file saved on your PC.

  For more information on details, refer to [the following](/docs/en/platform/biostar_x/enroll-credential-face#erollbywebcambyphoto).

* Period: Set a period for using the user account. You can either click on the date and time area to enter them manually or click  to select the desired date and time.

* Status: You can temporarily disable the user account.

Click Save in the upper right corner of the screen to save the basic information you entered.

Info

* ID may have different values that can be set according to the Server menu under Settings → User ID Type option. For more information on details, refer to [the following](/docs/en/platform/biostar_x/settings-server-server#userid-type).

  * Number: Enter a number from 1 to 4294967294.

  * Alphanumeric: Enter a combination of letters and numbers.

* Spaces cannot be included with the value of ID.

* The username can be up to 48 characters, including special characters.

  > Special characters: `~` `!` `@` `#` `$` `%` `^` `&` `(` `)` `-` `_` `=` `+` `[` `]` `{` `}` `;` `` ` ``

* To display the user's photo, department, and position on the mobile access card, ensure to add a photo and enter the department and position.

* Position and department names can be entered up to 64 characters, including special characters, `spaces`, and `_`.

* If using a mobile access card, be sure to enter the user's email when sending via email.

* To use face mobile enrollment or BioStar X QR, be sure to enter the user's email address.

### Check Network Priority

Instructions for checking and setting the server's network priority before installing **BioStar X**.

#### When is it needed?[​](#when-is-it-needed "Direct link to When is it needed?")

You need to check and set network priority in the following situations.

* When two or more network adapters are installed on the server

* When a specific network adapter must be used for the **BioStar X** service

* To prevent network connection issues after installing **BioStar X**

Info

If none of the above situations apply, there is no need to change the network priority. Skip this step and proceed with the installation of **BioStar X**. For more information on installing **BioStar X**, refer to [the following](/docs/en/platform/biostar_x/express-install).

Warning

A network adapter with a lower metric (higher priority) will be automatically selected during the installation of **BioStar X**. Since it may be difficult to change this setting after installation, be sure to check and adjust the network priority before installation.

#### Check Network Priority[​](#check-network-priority "Direct link to Check Network Priority")

### Face Migration

You can upgrade the faces enrolled in the previous version of **BioStar X** to enhance recognition performance using the latest algorithm. The synchronization protocol has been improved to only transmit templates, excluding the actual images during user synchronization. Additionally, this helps significantly reduce synchronization time and prevent privacy-related issues.

#### Before start[​](#before-start "Direct link to Before start")

Before running the face migration feature, check the following items.

**What is face migration?**

It is a feature that generates two types of face templates from user images already stored on the BioStar X server. To synchronize only the template for facial authentication during user synchronization, proceed with Face Migration.

##### Supported device and firmware version[​](#supported-device-and-firmware-version "Direct link to Supported device and firmware version")

Please refer to the list below for the devices that can synchronize the face with the template.

* FaceStation F2 firmware v2.2.0 or later

* BioStation 3 firmware v1.3.1 or later

* BioEntry W3 firmware v1.0.0 or later

**Notice on FaceStation F2 v1.x.x Firmware Support Discontinuation**

**BioStar X** optimized synchronization performance by changing to send only templates when synchronizing the user's face to the device. Therefore, support for the FaceStation F2 v1.x.x firmware, which can only extract templates from the device, will be discontinued. If you are currently using FaceStation F2 firmware version 1.x.x, upgrade to the latest firmware to use **BioStar X** with FaceStation F2.

The latest firmware can be downloaded from the [Suprema Download Center](https://download.supremainc.com/).

##### Notes on face template types[​](#notes-on-face-template-types "Direct link to Notes on face template types")

Differences in face template types for FaceStation F2, BioStation 3, and BioEntry W3.

* **NPU Type**: BioStation 3, BioEntry W3

* **GPU Type**: FaceStation F2

- **Synchronization Time Between Devices with Different Face Template Types**

  Before proceeding with Face Migration, if you synchronize by adding BioStation 3 or BioEntry W3 to an environment that only used FaceStation F2, the template type will differ, and the NPU type template will be extracted from the image, which may take considerable time depending on the number of faces enrolled on the server.

- **Face Enrollment Recommendations in BioStar X**

  When enrolling faces without using the option to **Store Face Image** on the device, only the template is synchronized with **BioStar X**. As a result, it cannot be synchronized to devices with different face template types. Therefore, it is recommended to enroll faces through **BioStar X**.

##### Device related notices[​](#device-related-notices "Direct link to Device related notices")

The user data file exported from **BioStar X** contains only templates without images, so the user data file cannot be imported into FaceStation F2 and BioStation 3 that are using existing firmware.

When data file export from FaceStation F2 and BioStation 3, the data files can only be exported using firmware versions above the following:

* FaceStation F2 firmware v2.2.0 or later

* BioStation 3 firmware v1.3.1 or later

Caution

When using FaceStation F2 or BioStation 3, it is recommended to upgrade to the latest firmware version. The latest firmware can be downloaded from the [Suprema Download Center](https://download.supremainc.com/).

#### How to face migration[​](#how-to-face-migration "Direct link to How to face migration")

1. Click User on the Launcher page.

2. Select the  button at the top right of the screen and click the Face Migration button.

   ![](/docs/en/img/en/biostarx-user-face-migration.png)

3. Check the contents of the warning popup and click Continue.

   ![](/docs/en/img/en/biostarx-user-face-migration-warning.png)

Proceeding with face migration. When face migration is complete, a result pop-up will appear. It will show the total number of faces enrolled, as well as the number of faces that were successfully migrated and those that failed.

* After a successful migration, sync the user information to the device to apply the changes. For more information about how to send user information to the device, refer to [the following](/docs/en/platform/biostar_x/transfer-user-info-to-device).

* If face migration fails, you can download a list of failed users as a CSV file. To delete all faces that failed migration, click the Delete button.

Info

* Only the admin account with user ID **1** can use this feature.

* Do not navigate away from the current page while the migration is in progress.

* The larger the size of the enrolled face images for each user, the longer it may take to generate the templates.

* For approximately 1,000 faces, the process takes about 18 minutes, although this may vary depending on server performance.

* For more information about how to save only the template without saving the user's facial image to the server, refer to [the following](/docs/en/platform/biostar_x/settings-server-server#storevisualfaceimage).

### Anti-passback

Anti-passback provides enhanced features compared to anti-passback generated based on doors or devices. Set up anti-passback to force users to use designated doors and devices upon entry and exit. This prevents unauthorized re-entry and enhances security.

Info

**APB (Anti-passback)**: A structural method used to control access. This function uses access control devices installed both inside and outside the door, so that authentication is required for access to the zone. In the case of card-based access control systems, if a person enters a zone following the person in front without swiping their card on the reader, the door does not open when the person attempts to leave the zone, and subsequently an anti-passback event occurs. Anti-passback is categorized into hard APB and soft APB. If the anti-passback is violated, the anti-passback event is created immediately and hard APB does not permit access to the user while soft APB still permits access to the user.

#### CSN Mobile Card Deletion Management Guidelines[​](#csn-mobile-card-deletion-management-guidelines "Direct link to CSN Mobile Card Deletion Management Guidelines")

When using CSN mobile cards integrated with the Airfob Portal Regular Site in **BioStar X**, if a user deletes a card, the same card ID could be reissued to another user. However, this could lead to an issue where the original cardholder could still access the premises even after the card has been reissued.

To address this issue, **BioStar X** provides the feature to manage deletion history after deleting CSN mobile cards.

##### Separate management of deleted CSN mobile cards[​](#separate-management-of-deleted-csn-mobile-cards "Direct link to Separate management of deleted CSN mobile cards")

Deleted CSN mobile cards are recorded in the Settings → Card → Deleted CSN Mobile Card list. In this list, you can view the Card Type, Card Data Format, Card ID, and Last Cardholder.

##### Preventing reissuance of deleted card IDs[​](#preventing-reissuance-of-deleted-card-ids "Direct link to Preventing reissuance of deleted card IDs")

If there is a history of deletion for a CSN mobile card, the system will prevent that card ID from being reissued to another user.

If you wish to issue a card with a deleted card ID, you can only do so after excluding the corresponding CSN mobile card from the Deleted CSN Mobile Card list.

![](/docs/en/img/en/biostarx-settings-credentail-mobile-card-exclude.png)

Info

CSN mobile cards included in the Deleted CSN Mobile Card list cannot be deleted from the Unassigned Card list.

To delete a card from the Unassigned Card list, first remove the card from the Deleted CSN Mobile Card list and then proceed with the deletion.

* External Remote Access 기능을 사용하려면 ngrok의 **Pay-as-you-go** 플랜을 구독해야 합니다. ngrok 플랜에 대한 자세한 내용은 [다음 링크](https://ngrok.com/pricing)를 참고하세요.

  ngrok의 **Free** 또는 **Hobbyist** 플랜에서는 밴드 폭 제한, 동시 터널 제한 등으로 인해 안정적인 리모트 액세스 연결이 어려울 수 있습니다.

External Remote Access VS Remote Access

* Remote Access 기능은 라이선스 구매를 통해서 사용자에게 ngrok 슈프리마 사이트의 bot 계정, 엔드포인트를 제공하여 외부 네트워크에서의 연결을 지원하는 기능입니다. Remote Access 기능에 대한 자세한 내용은 [다음 문서](/docs/en/platform/biostar_x/settings-remote-access)를 참고하세요.

* 반면, External Remote Access 기능은 사용자가 소유한 ngrok 계정을 통해 외부 네트워크에서 내부 네트워크로의 연결을 지원하는 기능입니다. 사용자는 직접 ngrok 계정을 생성하고, ngrok 설정 정보를 입력해야 합니다.

Caution

* 리모트 액세스(Remote Access) 기능은 제3자 서비스인 ngrok의 터널링 서비스를 통해 제공됩니다. 기능 사용 전 반드시 [Remote Access 기능 사용 동의](/docs/en/legal/eula#remote-access-agreement) 약관을 확인하세요.

* BioStar X는 단순히 ngrok API를 호출하여 연결을 지원할 뿐, 인터넷 연결의 보안성, 안전성, 연속성은 ngrok 서비스에 전적으로 의존합니다. 따라서 본 기능 사용 중 발생할 수 있는 보안 사고, 데이터 손실, 시스템 침해 등에 대하여 슈프리마는 어떠한 책임도 지지 않습니다.

* **BioStar X**는 보안상 이유로 ngrok 실행 파일(`ngrok.exe`)의 유효성을 검사합니다. **BioStar X** 패키지에 포함된 파일만 사용 가능하며, 외부에서 다운로드한 ngrok 실행 파일을 임의로 사용할 수 없습니다. 승인되지 않은 파일을 사용하면 정상적으로 작동하지 않을 수 있습니다.

#### 언제 사용하나요?[​](#whenShoulduseit "Direct link to 언제 사용하나요?")

다음과 같은 상황에서 리모트 액세스 기능을 사용하세요.

* 현재 소유한 ngrok 계정이 있으면서, 외부 네트워크에서 사내 **BioStar X** 서버에 접속해야 할 때

* 방화벽이나 NAT 환경으로 인해 직접 접속이 어려운 경우

* 복잡한 네트워크 설정 없이 간편하게 원격 접속을 구성하고 싶을 때

* 임시로 외부 접속 권한을 제공해야 하는 경우

#### 시작하기 전에[​](#beforeStart "Direct link to 시작하기 전에")

##### 네트워크 설정 확인[​](#checkNetworksettings "Direct link to 네트워크 설정 확인")

External Remote Access 기능을 사용하려면 **BioStar X** 서버와 ngrok 간의 통신이 필요합니다. 서버의 방화벽 설정에서 다음을 확인하세요.

* **인바운드 규칙**: **BioStar X**가 사용 중인 포트(기본값: **443**)에 대한 인바운드 트래픽 허용

* **아웃바운드 규칙**: ngrok 서비스와의 통신을 위한 아웃바운드 트래픽 허용 (포트: **443**)

방화벽 설정에서 이 규칙들이 활성화되어 있지 않으면 ngrok 연결에 실패할 수 있습니다.

Info

ngrok은 HTTPS 엔드포인트의 경우 포트 **443**으로만 트래픽을 수신합니다. ngrok 도메인에서 사용하는 포트는 변경할 수 없습니다. 자세한 내용은 [다음 링크](https://ngrok.com/docs/faq/faq#can-i-choose-a-different-port-to-receive-traffic-on-my-ngrok-domains)를 참고하세요.

### System Minimum Requirements

**BioStar X** provides a reliable and scalable integrated security management solution for large enterprise environments. The system can efficiently manage over a thousand devices through a distributed architecture consisting of a main server and a communication server.

The main server manages the core management features of the system, while the communication server is responsible for device communication, distributing the load and optimizing performance. Additionally, administrators can access the system via a web browser on client PCs and perform all management tasks. Check the system requirements below to configure the optimal environment for your organization size.

Info

For more information on license configuration and optimization, contact the [Suprema Technical Support](https://support.supremainc.com).

### Set Shift

This guide explains how to configure the attendance management rules by setting the work schedule in hourly, daily, and weekly units.

If this is your first time registering working rules, follow the steps below to configure it.

#### Time Code

You can set time rules for attendance record management, overtime, and absences. You can set hourly weights and can color code them for easy identification.

For more information on Time Code settings, refer to [the following](/docs/en/platform/biostar_x/tna-rule-shift-paycode).

#### Shift[​](#-1 "Direct link to -1")

You can set daily working rules based on a 24-hour period. Working rules include time rule settings based on time, daily start time settings, and time rounding rules.

For more information on Shift settings, refer to [the following](/docs/en/platform/biostar_x/tna-rule-shift-day).

#### Schedule Template[​](#-2 "Direct link to -2")

You can set weekly work rules based on the daily work rules configured. You can set weekly work rules on a weekly or daily basis.

For more information on Schedule Template settings, refer to [the following](/docs/en/platform/biostar_x/tna-rule-shift-schedule).

#### Rule[​](#-3 "Direct link to -3")

This can be useful when you have not added overtime rules to the daily working rules. The overtime set in daily working rules has start and end times, but Rule calculates the total time exceeding the regular working hours. Rule can be conveniently used when managing the total overtime hours daily/weekly/monthly, and if you set Rule, it will apply instead of the overtime rule added to the working rules.

For more information on Rule settings, refer to [the following](/docs/en/platform/biostar_x/tna-rule-shift-overtime).

#### Work schedule[​](#work-schedule "Direct link to Work schedule")

You can set the period to apply the working schedule configured in the previous step, along with users, other working rules, and leave schedules.

For more information on Schedule settings, refer to [the following](/docs/en/platform/biostar_x/tna-rule-schedule).

        if data.get("Response", {}).get("code") == "0":
            # Decrypt session ID
            encrypted_session = data.get("bs_session_id")
            bs_session_id = decrypt_aes256_base64(encrypted_session, key)
        else:
            # Handle BioStar X errors
            error_msg = data.get("Response", {}).get("message", "unknown error")
            raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail=f"BioStar X error: {error_msg}")

#### CRC Calculation and Validation[​](#crc "Direct link to CRC Calculation and Validation")

CRC-16 CCITT checksums (`hdrCRC`, `cardCRC`) are used for the header and card data respectively, to ensure the integrity of SmartCard data.

##### What are hdrCRC and cardCRC?[​](#hdrcrc-cardcrc "Direct link to What are hdrCRC and cardCRC?")

* `hdrCRC`: The value calculated using CRC-16 CCITT (polynomial 0x1021, initial value 0xFFFF) for the `cardCRC` to `reserved` (14 bytes total) of `BS2SmartCardHeader`.

* `cardCRC`: The value calculated using CRC-16 CCITT (polynomial 0x1021, initial value 0xFFFF) for card data from `cardType` to `BS2SmartCardData.accessOnData` (total card data excluding the header).

##### How to Calculate CRC[​](#crc-calculation "Direct link to How to Calculate CRC")

The [BioStar 2 SDK](https://kb.supremainc.com/bs2sdk/doku.php) provides the **BS2\_ComputeCRC16CCITT** function. Below is an example of its use.

Calculate checksum

```
// Calculate card data checksum (cardCRC)
uint16_t cardCRC = 0xFFFF;
int result = BS2_ComputeCRC16CCITT((uint8_t*)&card.header.cardType, sizeof(BS2SmartCardData) - offsetof(BS2SmartCardHeader, cardType), &cardCRC);

// Calculate header checksum (hdrCRC)
card.header.cardCRC = cardCRC;  // Set the cardCRC value first
uint16_t hdrCRC = 0xFFFF;
result = BS2_ComputeCRC16CCITT((uint8_t*)&card.header.cardCRC, sizeof(BS2SmartCardHeader) - offsetof(BS2SmartCardHeader, cardCRC), &hdrCRC);
```

* `cardCRC` is calculated from `cardType` to `accessOnData`.

* `hdrCRC` is calculated from `cardCRC` to `reserved`.

* Always calculate `cardCRC` first, set it in the header, then calculate `hdrCRC`.

##### How to Validate[​](#crc-validation "Direct link to How to Validate")

To validate the integrity of card data when reading, do the following:

1. Recalculate CRC using data read from the card.

2. Compare the stored CRC value with the calculated CRC value.

CRC Validation

```
// CRC validation example
BS2SmartCardData readCard;  // Data read from card

// 1. cardCRC validation
uint16_t calculatedCardCRC = 0xFFFF;
BS2_ComputeCRC16CCITT((uint8_t*)&readCard.header.cardType, sizeof(BS2SmartCardData) - offsetof(BS2SmartCardHeader, cardType), &calculatedCardCRC);

if (readCard.header.cardCRC != calculatedCardCRC) {
    // Card data corruption
    return ERROR_CARD_DATA_CORRUPTED;
}

// 2. hdrCRC validation
uint16_t calculatedHdrCRC = 0xFFFF;
BS2_ComputeCRC16CCITT((uint8_t*)&readCard.header.cardCRC, sizeof(BS2SmartCardHeader) - offsetof(BS2SmartCardHeader, cardCRC), &calculatedHdrCRC);

if (readCard.header.hdrCRC != calculatedHdrCRC) {
    // Header data corruption
    return ERROR_HEADER_DATA_CORRUPTED;
}
```

**Cautions for CRC Calculation**

* **Calculation Order**: Calculate `cardCRC` first, set it in the header, and then calculate `hdrCRC`.

* **Structure Alignment**: Ensure the CRC calculation range matches precisely, and be cautious of structure padding and alignment.

* **Initial Value**: CRC-16 CCITT uses polynomial 0x1021 and **initial value 0xFFFF**.

* **SDK Function**: The `BS2_ComputeCRC16CCITT` function is provided in the [BioStar 2 SDK](https://kb.supremainc.com/bs2sdk/doku.php).

* **Data Order**: Input data is processed in little-endian byte order.
