The Enrollment Helper provides an enrollment window for fingerprints and faces on the Net2 Access Control system. If you install the Enrollment Helper, you can enroll fingerprints and faces by opening a window for enrollment directly from the Net2 Access Control system.

The enrollment helper is automatically installed with the installation of the integration.

    * A user can login with an account that exists in BioStar 2. A login session is remembered, so you will not have to continuously log in, this uses the session timeout value from BioStar 2.

    * Click <Image src='/img/integration/ico-enroll-credential-existing-user-setting.png' ico /> to change the BioStar 2 Address and port. You can also enter an SMTP password if QR email is used. There is also an option if IR face is being used (FS2/FL devices).

1. Lastly, there is **Send QR Email**, this uses an SMTP client within the enrollment helper itself, so will need a copy of the SMTP password (Mentioned in tip earlier), this also requires an existing token number to be registered to the user in Net2. If successful, QR will prompt as sent, you can then press **Exit**.

### Enroll Credentials to New User

1. Run **Net2 Access Control**.

1. Click **Users** menu and double-click <Image src='/img/integration/ico-enroll-credentials-new-user.png' ico /> New user.

1. Enter the user information to add and click **Add Biometric**.

    <Image src='/img/integration/enroll-credentials-new-user3.png' alone />

1. The rest of enrollment is similar to above, but because the user is a **New User**, the user will not have an email within BioStar 2, so both email options are disabled, if email is required, first add user in Net2 with Email then wait for sync to BioStar 2.
