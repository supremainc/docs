# Settings – Site Settings

Managing your site settings in BioStar Air is essential for effective administration. This guide will walk you through the available settings and how to configure them.

## Accessing Site Settings

To navigate to your site settings in the BioStar Air web portal:

* Go to**Settings**on the left-hand menu.
* Select**Site**. This section contains most of the settings you’ll need.

## Site Profile

* **Site Name:**Displays the name of your site, which can be changed at any time by typing a new name and clicking**Apply**.
* \*\*Site ID:\*\*A unique identifier useful for support requests. You can copy and paste it when communicating with the MOCA team.
* \*\*Country:\*\*Set during site creation and cannot be changed later. If a change is necessary, it must be done through the Airfob Partner Portal.

## Site Settings

* \*\*Time Zone:\*\*Can be changed at any time.
* \*\*Use DST:\*\*Enables or disables daylight saving time, applicable in certain regions.
* \*\*T\&A on Mobile:\*\*Related to time and attendance features, covered in a separate guide.
* \*\*Long Press (Touch & Hold):\*\*Allows users to press and hold a mobile credential in the Suprema Pass app to open doors from a distance—useful for parking gates.
* **Event Log Time Display:**
  * \*\*Device Time:\*\*Displays event logs based on each device’s time zone (configured in device settings).
  * \*\*Site Time:\*\*Displays logs in the site’s time zone—useful for sites with all devices in one location.

## Security Settings

* \*\*Email Authentication:\*\*Requires administrators to verify login attempts via email for two-factor authentication.
* \*\*Set Full Access by Default:\*\*Grants new users full access by default. Disabling this requires manual access level assignment. Temporary Users never receive full access automatically, even if the above setting is enabled.
* \*\*Password Strength:\*\*Options include Weak, Medium, or Strong to align with security policies.
* \*\*Password Validity Period:\*\*Requires password resets every 30, 60, or 90 days.
* \*\*Max Offline Time:\*\*Defines how long a mobile credential remains valid without an internet connection.
  * Default: 5 minutes.
  * Can be set from 1 minute to 8 days.
  * Useful for balancing security and convenience, especially in remote sites with limited connectivity.

## Management

The only option available under this tab is**Delete Site**. This action is irreversible and can only be performed by a**Master Administrator**.

## Additional Features

* \*\*QR Reader:\*\*Enables support for QR code readers connected to Airfob Edge readers. If no QR readers are in use, this setting should remain off.
* \*\*Video Management:\*\*Supports ONVIF-compatible IP cameras. This must be activated to integrate video surveillance with BioStar Air.

By configuring these settings properly, you can ensure that your BioStar Air site operates smoothly and securely.
