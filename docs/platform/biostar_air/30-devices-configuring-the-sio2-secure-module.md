# Devices - Configuring the SIO2 Secure Module

## Overview

The**SIO2 Secure Module**enhances security in your access control system by acting as an intermediary between the Airfob reader and the relay. It communicates with the Airfob device via an**RS485 cable**, with encrypted communication to prevent security breaches.

## Important Notes

**âš  Please refer to the wiring diagrams included in the box with your SIO2 Secure Module for accurate setup instructions.**

Since installation may vary depending on the environment, professional assistance from your local Airfob installer may be required.

## How to Activate SIO2 in the BioStar Air Portal

\*\*Note:\*\*If you do not change the settings in the BioStar Air portal after installing SIO2, it will not function as an Airfob device.

### 1. Register the Airfob Device

* Ensure the Airfob device, SIO2, and door relay are successfully connected.
* Register the Airfob device on your site using the**BioStar Air app**.

### 2. Check Device Connection

* Access the**BioStar Air portal**.
* Navigate to**Device Management > Registered Devices**.
* Ensure the device shows a**green status indicator**, confirming its connection.

### 3. Assign SIO2 to a Door

* Go to**Door Management > Registered Door**.
* Find the door where the device is connected. (The door is automatically created when the device is registered.)

### 4. Enable SIO2

* In the**Assign Devices**area, a pop-up screen will appear.
* Toggle on**SIO2**to activate it.

### 5. Configure Relay and Sensors

* For**Door Relay**, select**Relay 0**. (The SIO2 module has only one Door Relay port.)
* For**Door Sensor**, select the input port number on the SIO2 where the Door Sensor is connected.
* If an**Exit Button**is connected, select the corresponding input port on the SIO2.
* If using another type of exit device, select**Exit Devices**instead.

### 6. Save the Settings

* Click the**Save**button to apply the configuration.
* The SIO2 Secure Module will now function normally.

Following these steps ensures that your SIO2 Secure Module is properly integrated and enhances the security of your access control system.
