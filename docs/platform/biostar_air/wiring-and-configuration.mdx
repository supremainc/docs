## Step 1: Wiring {#wiring}

Wire the E200 series QR scanner using the included adapter cable, as shown below.

* The green terminal block has pins labeled **1 to 4**, **right to left** (when facing the front of the connector).

  :::note

  This is the opposite of many other connectors—double-check orientation before wiring._

  :::

  | Pin | Wire Color | Function |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | 1 | Black | Negative / Ground |
  | 2 | Red | Positive (V+) |
  | 3 | Yellow (white stripe) | RS-485 TRXN |
  | 4 | Blue (white stripe) | RS-485 TRXP |

* Connect the white 4-pin pin-and-socket connector to the **CON**port on the bottom of the QR scanner.

  This connector is **polarized** (with a groove), so it only fits in one direction.

## Step 2: Enable QR Reader {#enable-qr-reader}

In the **BioStar Air** admin portal (web or app), navigate to:

**Device Management** → **Devices** → click or tap the device with the E200 QR scanner connected.

* Under **Details**, find the **QR Reader** option.

* Click or tap the toggle switch to turn it **on**. Refer to the image on the right.

:::note

Enabling the QR reader disables the use of other RS-485-connected devices (e.g., SIO2) on the same reader.

## Step 3: Configure the QR Scanner {#configure-qr-scanner}

By default, the **E200 QR scanner** is set to a baud rate of **115,200**.

To use it with **Suprema readers**, you must change the baud rate to **9,600**.

* After connecting the QR scanner to the reader, **scan the barcode below** to apply the new baud rate.

**That’s it!**

As long as your wiring is correct and your Suprema reader has an active network connection, you’ll be able to use **dynamic QR credentials** provisioned through BioStar Air.
