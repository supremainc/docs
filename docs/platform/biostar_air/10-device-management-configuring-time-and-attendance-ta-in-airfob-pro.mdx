## Feature Overview {#feature-overview}

BioStar Air provides basic Time & Attendance (T&A) tracking by recording shift and break times, which can be exported or integrated with an external T&A system. While BioStar Air does not offer a full T&A management system, it supports event logging and API integrations with payroll and attendance systems. It also allows for export of a basic "hours worked" report.

## How T&A Works in BioStar Air {#how-t-and-a-works}

Users can log T&A events such as:

* **Start Shift**

* **End Shift**

* **Start Break**

* **End Break**

These events are recorded in the event logs and can be exported as a CSV file or retrieved via API.


## Setting Up Mobile T&A {#setting-up-mobile-t-and-a}

To enable Mobile T&A:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Site** → **Settings**.

1. Ensure you are logged in as a **master administrator**.

1. Find **T&A on Mobile** and activate it.

1. Set labels for T&A keys (e.g., Start Shift, End Shift, Start Break, End Break).

1. Specify whether each event is a **Clock-In** or **Clock-Out** event.

1. Click **Save** to confirm.

## Assigning T&A to Devices {#assigning-tanda-to-devices}

Once Mobile T&A is activated, specify which devices should use it:

1. Go to **Device Management** and select a registered device.

1. Scroll down to **T&A Settings** and select **Mobile**.

1. Choose whether T&A selection is **required** or **optional**.

1. Click **Save** to apply settings.

T&A event labels are managed at the site level and cannot be changed per device.

## Viewing and Exporting T&A Logs {#viewing-and-exporting-t-and-a-logs}

T&A events are recorded in the event logs.

1. Go to **Monitoring** → **Event Logs**.

1. Locate the **T&A Column** in the log table.

1. Customize the log table to move the T&A column for better visibility.

1. Click **Export** to download the data as a CSV file.


## Alternative T&A Options {#alternative-tanda-options}

Devices can record T&A events in different ways:

### Disabled {#disabled}

* The device does not record any T&A data.

### By Schedule {#by-schedule}

* Defines clock-in and clock-out times based on a set schedule.

* For example, events logged between 8:00 AM - 12:00 PM are recorded as **Clock-In**, and events between 1:00 PM - 5:00 PM are recorded as **Clock-Out**.

### Fixed {#fixed}

* Assigns a fixed T&A code (e.g., Start Shift) to a reader.

* Every authentication at this reader logs the same T&A event.

* Useful for dedicated T&A readers (e.g., one reader for clock-in, another for clock-out).

### Mobile {#mobile}

* Users must select a T&A code before authenticating.

* The selected T&A event is recorded along with access logs.

## Finalizing T&A Configuration {#finalizing-t-and-a-configuration}

Once T&A settings are configured, ensure all changes are saved:

* Click **Save** to apply changes.

* Click **Cancel** to discard modifications.
