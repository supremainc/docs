## Feature Overview {#feature-overview}

LinkPass is an app-free mobile credential available in BioStar Air. It allows administrators to grant door access to users without requiring any app installation or use of BLE/NFC. LinkPass works entirely through the BioStar Air cloud and is activated via a secure web link, making it ideal for guest access, deliveries, or low-security entry points such as parking gates and lobbies.


## Navigating to the Feature {#navigating-to-the-feature}

To issue a LinkPass credential:

* Log in to the **BioStar Air Admin Portal**

* Navigate to **Users**

* Create a new user or edit an existing user

* Scroll down to the **Card Detail** section

* Enable **Web Card**

* Check the box next to **LinkPass**


## Step-by-Step Instructions {#step-by-step-instructions}

1. Sign in to the **BioStar Air Admin Portal**.

1. Go to the **Users** tab and select an existing user or click **+ Add User** to create a new one.

1. In the user detail view, scroll to the **Card Detail** section.

1. Enable the **Web Card** option.

1. Check the box next to **LinkPass**.

1. Assign a valid **email address or phone number** to the user to ensure they receive the credential link.

1. Assign appropriate **access levels** and set the **validity period** for the user.

1. Click **Save** to issue the credential.

1. The user will receive an invitation via email or SMS with a unique LinkPass URL.


## How Users Use LinkPass {#how-users-use-linkpass}

1. The user opens the LinkPass URL from the message they received.

1. A webpage displays all doors assigned to them, each with an **Open** button.

1. Clicking **Open** sends a cloud-based unlock command to the reader—no BLE or NFC is needed.


## Common Issues & Considerations {#common-issues-and-considerations}

* **Credential Scope**: LinkPass credentials allow access to the same doors as any other credential assigned to the user. For this reason, **do not issue LinkPass credentials to users with access to secure areas**.

* **No App Required**: LinkPass operates via a web browser—no mobile app, Bluetooth, or NFC is required.

* **Cloud-Based Access**: LinkPass commands are transmitted through the BioStar Air cloud and can be activated from anywhere with internet access. There is no geofencing.

* **Reader Connectivity**: Door readers must be online and connected to BioStar Air for LinkPass to function correctly.

* **Use Case Recommendation**: LinkPass is best suited for temporary visitors, deliveries, and low-security areas like lobbies or parking gates.
