## Feature Overview {#feature-overview}

BioStar Air now supports biometric readers and biometric credentials for secure access control. Compatible biometric readers, such as BioStation 3 (BS3) and BioEntry W3 (W3), can be registered and configured to authenticate users using facial recognition. The feature supports both single-factor and two-factor authentication, offering enhanced flexibility and security.


## Navigating to the Feature {#navigating-to-the-feature}

* **Register readers**: Use the **BioStar Air app** on your phone, following the same process as you do to register non-biometric readers.

* **Device settings**: Admin Portal → **Device Management** → **Registered Devices** → Click device to edit.

* **User face credential setup**: Admin Portal → **User Management** → **Users** → Add or Edit User → Scroll to **Credential Detail**.


## Step-by-Step Instructions {#step-by-step-instructions}

<Steps>
<Step>

### Register a Biometric Reader {#register-a-biometric-reader}

1. Ensure the reader (W3 or BS3) has BioStar Air-compatible firmware. If you ordered a device with -AIR at the end of the model name directly from Suprema or an authorized dealer, it will already have the correct firmware.

1. Open the BioStar Air app on your phone and log in using your administrator ID and password.

1. Register the device as you would for any other reader.

</Step>
<Step>

### Configure Reader Settings {#configure-reader-settings}

1. Go to **Device Management** in the Admin Portal.

1. Select **Registered Devices** and click on the device to edit.

1. Scroll down to the **Authentication** section.

1. Set the **Authentication Mode**:

    * **Single-factor:** RF card or face (default).

    * **Two-factor:** Delete one method, then re-register using both RF card and face to enable combined authentication.

1. Set **Authentication Timeout** (in seconds).

1. In the **Face** section, adjust:

    * **Security level** (1:N Security Level)

    * **Motion sensor sensitivity**

    * **Maximum head pose angle**

    * **Detection distance**

1. Choose **Operation Mode**:

    * **Fast Matching:** Uses visual face template only.

    * **Fusion Matching:** Combines visual and IR face templates for higher security.

1. Configure additional options:

    * Storage format for face templates (Store Visual Template)

    * Duplicate checking

    * Set enrollment timeout

    * Enable or disable mask detection

</Step>
<Step>

### Add or Edit User and Enroll Face {#add-or-edit-user-and-enroll-face}

1. Navigate to **User Management** → **Users**.

1. Add a new user or edit an existing one.

1. Scroll to the **Credential Detail** section and enable **Face**.

1. Click the plus sign on one of the placeholders to add a face template.

    Options:

    * Select a file from your computer

    * Use a connected biometric device (W3 or BS3)

    * Click **Register on Mobile** to scan the QR code with your phone

    :::note

    Only two face photos can be uploaded per user. One photo is typically sufficient.

    :::

1. Click **Save** to complete the user setup.

</Step>

</Steps>


## Common Issues & Considerations {#common-issues-considerations}

* Readers must have BioStar Air-compatible firmware loaded to function correctly.

* Face templates are limited to two per user.

* For advanced configuration (e.g., security levels, matching modes), refer to the W3 or BS3 manual.

* For two-factor authentication, credentials must be registered in combination (e.g., RF card + face).
