## Overview {#overview}

BioStar Air provides the capability to create **federated sites**, allowing a primary site to manage multiple sub-sites seamlessly. This feature is ideal for multi-tenant buildings or multi-branch organizations, offering centralized control with distributed access management.


## What Are Federated Sites? {#what-are-federated-sites}

Federated sites enable a hierarchical structure where a **primary site** oversees one or more **sub-sites**. Administrators on the primary site, known as **Federated Admins**, can access and manage sub-sites directly through the Airfob Pro interface.


## Why Use Federated Sites? {#why-use-federated-sites}

Federated sites are beneficial in the following scenarios:

### Multi-Tenant Buildings {#multi-tenant-buildings}

For example, in a commercial building with different companies occupying each floor, you can establish:

* A **master account** for the building.

* **Sub-accounts** for each tenant company.

This setup ensures only authorized employees access specific floors while simplifying management for the building administrator.

### Multi-Branch Organizations {#multi-branch-organizations}

For companies with offices in multiple locations, you can set up:

* A **master account** to manage global settings.

* **Sub-accounts** for each branch.

For instance, a business with 10 offices worldwide can use a federated structure to streamline administration.


## How to Set Up Federated Sites {#how-to-set-up-federated-sites}

<Steps>
<Step>

### Access the Partner Portal {#access-the-partner-portal}

* The Airfob Partner Portal is exclusively available to partners and installers.

* End customers must contact their installer to configure this feature.

</Step>
<Step>

### Create the Primary Site

1. Log in to the **Partner Portal**.

1. Click **Create Site** and select **Federation Site** under the **Site Profile**.

    * This step **must** be done when setting up a site for the first time.

    * Regular sites cannot be changed into federated sites later.

1. Add **Federated Admins** on the same screen.

    * **Federated Admins** (added in the Partner Portal) have access to the primary site and all sub-sites.

    * **Regular Admins** (added in Airfob Pro) only manage individual sites.

</Step>
<Step>

### Add Sub-Sites

1. Once the primary site is set up as a federated site, the **Site List** will display an option to create sub-sites.

1. Click **Create Sub-Site** and configure it as you would any other site.

</Step>
</Steps>


## Important Considerations {#important-considerations}

### User and Reader Management {#user-and-reader-management}

* Users and readers must be added separately to each sub-site.

* Readers can only be registered to one site at a timeâ€”either the primary site or a sub-site.

### Primary Site Usage {#primary-site-usage}

* Some customers use the primary site solely as an access point for managing sub-sites, without registering users or readers to the primary site.

* **Example 1**: A company with three branch offices sets up a primary site with no devices and creates sub-sites for each branch.

* **Example 2**: A company with a headquarters and three branches registers users and readers at the headquarters (primary site) and sets up sub-sites for the branches.

### Billing {#billing}

* Billing is calculated based on the number of registered devices (readers) per site.

* There is no additional cost for creating a primary site without registered devices.

By utilizing the Federated Sites feature in Airfob Space, administrators can effectively manage access for complex environments, ensuring a secure, scalable, and streamlined experience for all stakeholders.
