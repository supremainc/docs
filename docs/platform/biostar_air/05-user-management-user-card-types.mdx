## Feature Overview {#feature-overview}

Starting from BioStar Air version 2.6, two distinct user types have been introduced to improve user management:

* **Regular Users**: Long-term users with permanent mobile credentials.

* **Temporary Users**: Guests who receive temporary web-based credentials.

## Regular User Card Types {#regular-user-card-typs}

Regular users can be issued the following credentials:

### Mobile Card {#mobile-card}

* A unique **Card ID** is automatically assigned but can be manually set.

* If using **Airfob Tag** or **Airfob Patch**, the mobile card number can be used as a card serial number to integrate with an existing access control system.

* For compatibility with previous systems, the mobile card ID can match the RF card number from an older site.

### QR Code {#qr-code}

* Regular users can access a **QR code** within their mobile card.

* The QR code is accessible by pressing a button on the mobile card interface.

### RF Card {#rf-card}

* An RF card number is automatically generated but can be manually assigned.

* For existing RF cards with a **CSN** (Card Serial Number), the CSN can be entered manually.


## Temporary User Card Types {#temporary-user-card-typs}

Temporary users do not receive mobile cards. Instead, they are issued **web-based credentials** that do not require an app download. The available options are:

### Web QR Code {#web-qr-code}

* Delivered via email or text message.

* Accessible through a web browser.

* Uses a **dynamic QR code** that updates every five minutes for enhanced security.

### Link Pass {#link-pass}

* Allows door access by clicking a button in a web browser.

* Delivered via email or text message.


## Managing Access Levels {#managing-access-levels}

Regardless of whether a user is regular or temporary, **access levels** must be set to control where their credentials grant access.

For temporary users, carefully assign limited access levels to ensure they do not receive credentials with unrestricted access.
