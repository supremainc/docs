## Device Overview {#device-overview}

The Airfob Patch and Tag devices upgrade existing access control readers or door locks to be compatible with BioStar Air mobile credentials.

* **Airfob Patch**: Ideal for wired readers and intercoms, this energy-harvesting device attaches without the need for wiring.

* **Airfob Tag**: Equipped with a coin cell battery, making it suitable for battery-powered devices like door locks.

<CustomerNote />


## Compatibility {#compatibility}

Both devices work with MIFARE 1K technology but are not compatible with 125 KHz "low frequency" readers or locks.


## Functionality {#functionality}

These devices operate by reading the encrypted Bluetooth BioStar Air credential from a mobile phone and emulating a MIFARE RFID signal. They attach to readers and locks using tape, requiring no wiring.


## Configuration Steps {#configuration-steps}

After installing your Tag or Patch and registering it with the BioStar Air app, follow these steps to configure your device:

<Steps>
<Step>

### Access the App {#access-the-app}

* Open the **BioStar Air** app.
* Log into the site where your Tag or Patch is registered.

</Step>
<Step>

### Navigate to Device Settings {#navigate-to-device-settings}

* Tap **Access Point** on the menu bar.

* Select **Device** to view a list of registered devices.

* Choose the Patch or Tag you wish to configure.

</Step>
<Step>

### Enable BLE Mode {#enable-ble-mode}

* Bring your phone close to the device.

* Toggle on **BLE Mode** in the app.

</Step>
<Step>

### Set Card ID Output Method {#set-card-id-output-method}

* Scroll to **Card ID Output Method** and tap **Edit**.

* Press **Select** next to **User Card ID**.

</Step>
<Step>

### Choose the Output Method {#choose-the-output-method}

* **None**: Select this option if no card ID should be transmitted. This setting is useful for Time & Attendance (T&A) purposes to extend battery life.

* **Fixed Device**: Transmits a constant, pre-programmed card ID. Useful for door locks or intercoms that require RFID cards to be programmed individually. The device log will only display this fixed card ID.

* **User Card ID**: Transmits a unique card ID for each user, aligning with existing RFID card numbers in access control systems. This allows seamless integration without issuing new physical cards.

* **Direct Input**: Manually specify the card ID to transmit. Useful for custom settings where a single ID must be used across multiple devices.

</Step>
<Step>

### Save Your Settings {#save-your-settings}

* Confirm your selections by pressing **Save** while your phone is near the device.

* A success message will confirm the update.

</Step>
</Steps>

By following these steps, you can ensure that your Airfob Tag and Patch devices are properly configured to meet your specific access control needs.
