# BioStar Air App – Advanced Features

## Feature Overview

The BioStar Air Mobile app includes advanced settings and security options to enhance user experience and access control functionality. Users can configure authentication methods, enable two-factor authentication, review access logs, report issues, and access support resources.

## Accessing Advanced Settings

To open hidden settings and additional menus:

* Tap the\*\*≡\*\*(hamburger) icon at the top of the main screen.
* Navigate to the specific setting you wish to modify.

## Contact Method

The app allows users to select their preferred method for communicating with access control devices:

### 1. Bluetooth

Users can choose between two Bluetooth authentication modes:

* \*\*Only While App is On-Screen:\*\*The mobile card is authenticated only when the app screen is open. This conserves battery but requires manually opening the app before accessing a door.
* \*\*Background Mode:\*\*The mobile card works even when the phone screen is off, as long as the app is running in the background. This mode is more convenient but consumes more battery. If the app is closed, it must be reopened to resume background functionality.

Android users with NFC-compatible devices can use NFC in addition to Bluetooth.

### 2. NFC

NFC authentication is available for**Android devices only**. Users can enable NFC alone or in combination with Bluetooth for faster access.

## Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

For added security, users can enable two-factor authentication using a**PIN, pattern, or biometric authentication**(face or fingerprint). This feature requires the app screen to be open during authentication, making it incompatible with background mode.

### Important Consideration:

* If you forget your PIN or pattern, you will need to**reinstall the app and re-download your mobile cards**.
