# Advanced Features - Managing Roll Call & Fire Muster in BioStar Air

## Feature Overview

The Roll Call & Fire Muster feature in BioStar Air allows organizations to track which employees have safely exited a building during an emergency. By setting up muster points and using the BioStar Air app, administrators can quickly account for all users and generate roll call history reports.

## Setting Up Muster Points

A muster point is a designated area where users can tap their credentials to mark themselves as safe during an emergency.

1. Go to**Advanced**>**Roll Call**in the BioStar Air portal.
2. Click**Add Muster Point**.
3. Enter a**Name**(e.g., "East Parking Lot").
4. Enter an optional**Description**(e.g., "Third pillar in the parking structure").
5. Add devices:
   * Click**Add Device**to assign a specific reader.
   * Alternatively, select a**Device Group**to include multiple muster point readers.
6. Add user groups:
   * Select**User Groups**that should report to this muster point.
   * Click**Add**after each selection.
7. Click**Save**to finalize the muster point setup.

### Best Practices for Muster Points

* Use**device groups**instead of individual devices to allow multiple muster points.
* Ensure that**only relevant users**are assigned to specific muster points, especially in large campuses with multiple buildings.
* Airfob Edge Readers support both**mobile and card authentication**, while Airfob Tag and Airfob Patch require mobile credentials.

1. Open the BioStar Air app.
2. Go to**All Menu**>**Roll Call**(under Advanced Features).
3. Press**Roll Call Start**.

### Marking Users Safe

Users can mark themselves safe by:

* Administrators manually marking users safe by pressing and holding the**Checkmark**button next to their name.

### Tracking Roll Call Progress

* Users can be filtered by their**Muster Group**.
* The search function allows finding specific individuals.
* The roll call is complete when:
  * All users are marked safe.
  * An administrator manually marks all users as safe.
  * 24 hours pass without completion.
