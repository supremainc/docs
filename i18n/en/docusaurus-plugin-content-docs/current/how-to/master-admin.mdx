The **Master Admin** feature is designed to **enhance device security** by **strengthening overall administrator privileges** and **preventing unauthorized access and configuration changes**.<br/>With this feature, you **must register a Master Admin** on the new device, and only registered Master Admins can access the administrator menu and change device settings.

The **Master Admin** feature is available **only on Suprema products that support user interface via LCD screen**.

:::info

* This feature is an essential policy to enhance device security.

* The Master Admin cannot be deleted directly, and they are **deleted only through factory reset**.

## Setting Up the Master Admin

### What is a Master Admin?

If you use the device without setting up a administrator, anyone can access the administrator menu and change device settings. The Master Admin feature addresses this security vulnerability by enforcing the setup of an overall administrator.

## How to Enhance Administrator Security on New Devices or Existing Devices with Upgraded Firmware

### New Devices

For new devices, registering a **Master Admin** is mandatory from the beginning. If you do not register a Master Admin, device usage will be restricted.

:::info

* On new devices, the **Master Admin** registration screen appears upon initial boot. You cannot proceed to the next screen unless you register a Master Admin.

* Even if you assign an overall device administrator via BioStar 2, you must register a **Master Admin** to use all device functions.

* The new device cannot be downgraded to a lower version.

### Upgraded Devices {#admin-two-step-authentication}

Devices upgraded via firmware do not provide **Master Admin** settings, but you can enhance administrator security by enabling the **Admin 2-step Authentication** option.

:::info

* The default value for **Admin 2-step Authentication** is single-step authentication.

* Two-step authentication can be activated only if all registered administrators have at least two types of credentials.

* The firmware upgrade device cannot be downgraded to a lower version after upgrading the firmware.

#### Setting Admin 2-step Authentication on Upgraded Devices

You can activate Admin 2-step Authentication in the **Settings → Device → Admin 2-step Authentication** menu.

* The **Admin 2-step Authentication** option appears only on devices upgraded to the latest firmware.

<Image src='/img/how-to/setting-two-step-authentication.png' caption width='300px' />

:::info

* If not all administrators have at least two types of credentials, activation will fail and an error message will appear.<br/>Enroll at least two types of credentials for all administrators, and then try again.

<Image src='/img/how-to/error-two-step-authentication.png' caption width='300px' />

:::

:::warning

* If you activate **Admin 2-step Authentication** and then delete credentials so that all administrators have fewer than two types, you will not be able to access the administrator menu if BioStar 2 connection is also unavailable. Therefore, exercise caution when deleting administrator credentials.

## Additional Information

* **Manual Device Hash Key Change**

  * When manually changing the device hash key, a warning message will indicate that Master Admin PINs will be deleted. Please confirm the message before proceeding.

* **RS-485 Biometric Image Transmission Restriction**

  * Biometric credential images are not transmitted over RS-485 communication, so substitute images appear when viewing the registered Master Admin face on slave devices.

<FaqsItems data={FaqData} />

{/* ## [TBD] Setting Master Admin via BioStar 2

:::info

* The Master Admin feature is supported from BioStar 2 v2.9.11.

* Devices upgraded via firmware do not display the Master Admin menu in BioStar 2 administrator settings.

:::

## [TBD] Batch Edit Master Admin

* You can batch edit Admin 2-step Authentication and credential enrollment.

* Batch editing overwrites with the enrolled credentials.

* You can enroll a face, fingerprint, card, and PIN credentials.

* If a selected device does not support a credential type, batch editing will fail for that device.

* New devices must also meet the minimum two-credential condition; if not, batch editing for that device will fail. */}
