Guide on how to register and manage developed plugins in **BioStar X Service Manager**.

## Preparations Before Registration

1. **Run Plugin Server**

   The plugin server must be running before registering the plugin. **BioStar X** checks the accessibility of the plugin server during the registration process.

2. **Check Network Access**

   Ensure that the **BioStar X** server can access the plugin server.

   ```bash
   # Test from BioStar X Server
   curl -H "X-BioStar-Ping: test123" http://localhost:8000/bsx
   ```

{/* ## 플러그인 등록 및 확인 */}
import RegisterPlugin from "../../common/_bsx-register-plugin.mdx"

<RegisterPlugin />

{/* 플러그인 관리 */}
import ManagePlugins from '../../common/_bsx-manage-plugins.mdx'

<ManagePlugins />
