Provides solutions for issues that may occur during the development, registration, and operation of the **BioStar X** plugin.

## Plugin registration failure

* Make sure the server is running before registering the plugin.

* Ensure that the <Badge className='get'>GET</Badge> `/bsx` endpoint responds correctly. You can test it using the `curl` command.

  ```bash
  curl -H "X-BioStar-Ping: test123" http://localhost:8000/bsx
  ```

* Check if the **BioStar X** server can access the plugin server URL.

## Authentication callback failure

* Check if the certificate file exists and is valid.

* Check the **BioStar X** server address and port in the <Cmd>SERVICE SETTINGS</Cmd> of the **BioStar X Service Manager**.

* Verify that the network between the plugin server and **BioStar X** server is connected.

## Decryption error

* Check the AES key generation and encryption process.

* Ensure that the IV derives from the same key.

## Debug tips

* Enable logging to check the details of requests and responses.

* Test endpoints individually before full integration.

* Simulate requests to the **BioStar X** server using the `curl` command.
