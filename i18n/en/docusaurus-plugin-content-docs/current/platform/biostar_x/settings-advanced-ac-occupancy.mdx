The occupancy limit feature is a key access control function to ensure the safety and efficiency of spaces. This feature allows administrators to set a maximum number of occupants that can enter simultaneously for each location, preventing overcrowding and enabling more systematic space management.

The main applications of the occupancy limit setting are as follows.

* **Safety Management**: Prevention of safety incidents by limiting the maximum number of occupants based on fire safety regulations or building capacity limits.

* **Space Efficiency**: Optimization of the work environment by maintaining appropriate occupancy in meeting rooms, laboratories, and workspaces.

* **Infectious Disease Response**: Management of personnel in situations requiring social distancing or crowd density restrictions.

* **Real-time monitoring**: Check the current occupancy and entry/exit status for each location in real time.

* **Automatic Alerts**: Immediate notifications to administrators upon reaching the set occupancy limit, enabling swift responses.

By utilizing these features, administrators can establish tailored personnel management policies suited to the characteristics of each space, ensuring safe and efficient facility operations.

## Setting options guide {#setting}

The details for the occupancy limit setting are as follows.

* <Cmd sid='zone.globalZone' product='2' />: You can check the scope of application. The occupancy limit setting supports only <Cmd sid='zone.globalZone.global' product='2' /> mode and can be set for all devices registered to **BioStar X**.

* <Cmd sid='common.activate' product='2' />: You can activate or temporarily deactivate the settings.

* <Cmd sid='zone.entryDevices' product='2' />: Select the device to be used when entering. You can choose from the list of registered devices.

* <Cmd sid='zone.exitDevices' product='2' />: Select the device to be used when exiting. You can choose from the list of registered devices.

* <Cmd sid='zone.occupancy.limit' product='2' />: Enter the number of persons to limit for entry. Entry is restricted if the number of individuals reaches the set occupancy limit. You can enter a number from 0 to 10,000, and setting it to 0 allows access without limits.

* <Cmd sid='zone.occupancy.autoCountReset' product='2' />: You can set the time to automatically initialize the stored occupancy count. Every day at the set time, the occupancy count and the number of always-passing individuals will be reset.

* <Cmd sid='zone.occupancy.list.almostFull' product='2' />: You can send an alert to the administrator or log an event before the number of entrants reaches the set limit. When occupancy pre-alerts are enabled, the <Cmd sid='zone.occupancy.1stLevel' product='2' /> input field becomes active. To set <Cmd sid='zone.occupancy.2stLevel' product='2' />, click the <IcAdd className='border radius' /> button.

* <Cmd sid='zone.occupancy.networkFailureAction' product='2' />: You can determine whether to allow entry and exit when a network error occurs with the configured device. When set to allow entry and exit, the entry restriction stops when the device loses network connection, and users can enter even if the actual number of entrants exceeds the limit.

:::info

* The same device cannot be set for both <Cmd sid='zone.entryDevices' product='2' /> and <Cmd sid='zone.exitDevices' product='2' /> at the same time.

* You can select up to 128 devices for <Cmd sid='zone.entryDevices' product='2' /> and <Cmd sid='zone.exitDevices' product='2' />.

* Devices configured with <Cmd sid='door.dualAuthentication' product='2' /> cannot be set as <Cmd sid='zone.entryDevices' product='2' /> and <Cmd sid='zone.exitDevices' product='2' />.

* Set the time for the <Cmd sid='zone.occupancy.autoCountReset' product='2' /> option while considering the standard time zone of the actual location. For example, if a **BioStar X** server is located in a UTC+1:00 region and the auto-reset time is set to 00:00, the **BioStar X** client in the UTC+2:00 region will have the occupancy automatically reset at 01:00.

* You can set up to 2 <Cmd sid='zone.occupancy.list.almostFull' product='2' /> limits, and only numbers smaller than the limit can be entered. <Cmd sid='zone.occupancy.1stLevel' product='2' /> and <Cmd sid='zone.occupancy.2stLevel' product='2' /> cannot be set to the same value.

* For more information about device registration, refer to the following.

## Always-pass personnel setting {#countByPass}

You can select access groups that can always bypass the occupancy limit setting. Users who belong to the always bypass group can enter and exit regardless of the occupancy count and will not be counted in the occupancy numbers. Currently active members who are always bypassing can be seen in the always bypass occupants column in the occupancy limit settings list.

:::info
