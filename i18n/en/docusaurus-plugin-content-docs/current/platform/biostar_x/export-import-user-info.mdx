You can utilize user information from a previous version or a different server by exporting or importing user data.

## CSV export/import {#csv-exportimport}

Save selected user information as a CSV file, or load saved CSV files. This allows for easy transfer of user information using CSV files.

:::info

* If there are custom user fields not added to **BioStar X**, the CSV file cannot be imported correctly. For more information on adding custom user fields, refer to [the following](settings-server-server#custom-field).

* If user information is entered in a language other than English or Korean, save the CSV file in UTF-8 format.

If an error occurs while importing information from the CSV file, you can review and upload only the erroneous CSV data.

:::info

* Mobile access cards can be issued through CSV import. When using the regular site, one credit will be deducted from the Airfob Portal for each mobile access card issued upon completion of the import. To avoid issuing mobile access cards, disable mapping.

* If the CSV file contains identical data to mobile access cards already issued to users registered in **BioStar X**, you can choose to maintain or overwrite the data, in which case existing mobile access cards will be retained.

* If the CSV file contains different data from mobile access cards issued to users registered in **BioStar X**, maintaining the data will keep existing mobile access cards, while overwriting will issue new mobile access cards to the respective users.

* When issuing mobile access cards through CSV import on a dynamic site, ensure to input values for the `mobile_start_datetime` and `mobile_expiry_datetime` fields.

* **BioStar X** QR cannot be issued through CSV import.

* User facial data can be enrolled through CSV import. For more information, refer to [the following](batch-import-face#import-csv).

* User PINs can be enrolled through CSV import. For more information, refer to [the following](enroll-credential-pin).

* If you add columns that do not match the saved CSV file, you cannot import the file into **BioStar X**.

:::

## Data file export/import {#exportimport-data-file}

User information can be stored on external storage (USB) for import into **BioStar X** or devices. Up to 500,000 user records can be transferred from the server to devices or between devices.

:::info

* Data exported from devices using outdated firmware cannot be imported into **BioStar X**. Always use the latest version of the firmware.

* Data cannot be imported if different fingerprint template formats are used. For example, data exported from devices using the Suprema fingerprint template format cannot be imported into devices using the ISO fingerprint template format.

* When importing user data, if fingerprint and face credentials stored on the **BioStar X** server already exist, it will be overwritten by the existing data.

* Data cannot be imported from devices with outdated firmware versions. Upgrade the device firmware to a compatible version.
