When using CSN mobile cards integrated with the Airpop Portal Regular Site in BioStar 2, if a user deletes a card, the same card ID could be reissued to another user. However, this could lead to an issue where the original cardholder could still access the premises even after the card has been reissued.

To address this issue, provides the feature to manage deletion history after deleting CSN mobile cards.

## Separate Management of Deleted CSN Mobile Cards

Deleted CSN mobile cards are recorded in the <Cmd sid='common.setting' product='2' /> → <Cmd sid='common.card' product='2' /> → <Cmd sid='setting.card.deletedCsnMobileCard' product='2' /> list. In this list, you can view the <Cmd sid='setting.card.cardType' product='2' />, <Cmd sid='user.cardList.th.cardFormat' product='2' />, <Cmd sid='setting.card.cardId' product='2' />, and <Cmd sid='setting.card.lastCardHolder' product='2' />.

## Preventing Reissuance of Deleted Card IDs

If there is a history of deletion for a CSN mobile card, the system will prevent that card ID from being reissued to another user.

To reissue a card with a deleted card ID, the corresponding CSN mobile card must first be removed from the <Cmd sid='setting.card.deletedCsnMobileCard' product='2' /> list.
