User groups can share common properties and permissions. When a user becomes a member of a group, they are automatically granted all properties of that group. A user can belong to only one user group.

* Instead of setting access permissions for individual users, you can create user groups by department or role and apply the same access permissions at once.

* Modifying the group's access permissions will automatically apply to all users belonging to that group, reducing the administrative workload. You can quickly adjust permissions when there are organizational changes or new projects.

* You can prevent unnecessary access and increase security by setting permissions by group.

* You can separately analyze the access logs of specific groups, making security audits and log management easier.

* User groups can apply detailed policies such as access limit times and restricted areas in integration with the access level.

## Add group {#group-additional}

Create groups to efficiently manage multiple users. By registering a name such as the organization the user belongs to, it can be managed conveniently.

:::info

* Registering the group name as the name of the organization or department that the user belongs to makes management easier.

* You can create sub-groups of the group sequentially up to 8 levels.

* The user group name can be up to 48 characters long.

* If you select a group from the user group list, only users belonging to that group will be displayed in the user list.
