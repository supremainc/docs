This document explains how to install the **Communication Server** of **BioStar X**. 

The communication server is a server dedicated to communication with access control devices. It helps to manage many devices reliably by installing separately from the main server. A single communication server can connect up to 1,000 devices, and you can add multiple communication servers as needed.

## Before starting {#start-before}

Before installing the communication server, check the following items.

* The communication server cannot be installed on the same server as the **BioStar X** server.

* The communication server can only be installed on a 64-bit operating system. For more information on the system minimum requirements, refer to [the following](system-requirements#communication-server).

* A multi-communication server license is required to install and connect the communication server. For more information on licensing policy, refer to [the following](licensing#features-add-ons).

### Pre-installation checks {#check-before-install}
