---

This document provides guidance on how to enroll user credentials. Users can enroll their fingerprints, faces, card information, and PINs as credentials. Credentials can be added or modified when registering or updating a user.

Go to the <Cmd sid='shell.header.launcher' /> → <Cmd sid='shell.header.user' /> page and enroll, add, or modify credentials in the following two ways:

import EnterUserPage from '../../common/_enter-user-page.mdx';

<EnterUserPage />

In the <Cmd sid='team.user.credential.title' /> section, the following items can be set. Refer to the descriptions for each item to set the appropriate user permissions.

<Image src='/img/biostarx-new-user-credential.png' />

:::info

Enroll credentials and set the appropriate security level in the <Cmd sid='team.user.credential.securityLevel.title' /> field. A higher security level may lead to a lower authentication rate or a higher false rejection rate (FRR).

<Glossary termid='credential' />

:::

## Setting Security Level {#securityLevel}

Regardless of the biometric 1:N security level set on the device, a separate security level can be assigned to the user. If users frequently fail authentication when the device's 1:N security level is set high, consider lowering the <Cmd sid='team.user.credential.securityLevel.title' /> to mitigate failed authentications. Set the desired level in the <Cmd sid='team.user.credential.securityLevel.title' /> field. The available values are as follows:

* <Cmd sid='team.user.credential.securityLevel.default' />

* <Cmd sid='team.user.credential.securityLevel.lowest' />

* <Cmd sid='team.user.credential.securityLevel.low' />

* <Cmd sid='team.user.credential.securityLevel.normal' />

* <Cmd sid='team.user.credential.securityLevel.high' />

* <Cmd sid='team.user.credential.securityLevel.highest' />

:::info

* If the <Cmd sid='team.user.permission.privateAuthMode' /> option in the <Cmd sid='team.user.permission.title' /> section is set to <Cmd>Biometric</Cmd>, the 1:1 security level cannot be applied because the user is unknown. The 1:1 security level can only be applied when authentication modes using user-specific cards or IDs are set. For more information about <Cmd sid='team.user.permission.privateAuthMode' />, refer to [this document](set-permission#privateAuthMode).

* Set an appropriate security level. A higher security level may result in a lower fingerprint authentication rate or higher [False Rejection Rate (FRR)](../../reference/glossary#frr).

:::

## Enrolling Fingerprint {#enroll-fingerprint}

Enroll a user's fingerprint to use as an authentication method for access. Enroll user fingerprint through devices that support fingerprint authentication. Fingerprints can be scanned on devices equipped with fingerprint scanners.

:::note

**Before enrolling fingerprints...**

* Ensure that the user's fingerprint is clean and dry.

* Do not enroll fingerprints that are injured or blurry.
