This document provides guidance on how to enroll user credentials. User credentials can include fingerprint, facial authentication, card information, and passwords. Credentials can be added or changed when registering or modifying a user.

Navigate to <Cmd sid='shell.header.launcher' /> → <Cmd sid='shell.header.user' /> page to enroll, add, or adjust credentials using two methods outlined below.

import EnterUserPage from '../../common/_enter-user-page.mdx';

<EnterUserPage />

In the <Cmd sid='team.user.credential.title' /> section, the items that can be set are as follows. Please refer to the descriptions of each item to set appropriate user permissions.

<Image src='/img/biostarx-new-user-credential.png' />

:::info
Enroll credentials and set an appropriate security level in the <Cmd sid='team.user.credential.securityLevel.title' /> item. Higher security levels might result in lower authentication rates or higher false rejection rates (FRR).

<Glossary termid='credential' />
:::

## Security Level Settings {#securityLevel}

Regardless of the biometric 1:N security level set on the device, a separate security level can be assigned to users. If users frequently fail authentication due to a high 1:N security level on the device, lower the <Cmd sid='team.user.credential.securityLevel.title' /> to mitigate authentication failures. Refer to the list below for configurable security level values.

* <Cmd sid='team.user.credential.securityLevel.default' />
* <Cmd sid='team.user.credential.securityLevel.lowest' />
* <Cmd sid='team.user.credential.securityLevel.low' />
* <Cmd sid='team.user.credential.securityLevel.normal' />
* <Cmd sid='team.user.credential.securityLevel.high' />
* <Cmd sid='team.user.credential.securityLevel.highest' />

:::info
If the <Cmd sid='team.user.permission.title' /> section's <Cmd sid='team.user.permission.privateAuthMode' /> option is set to <Cmd>Biometric</Cmd>, the 1:1 security level cannot be applied as the user will not be identifiable; it can only be applied when the authentication mode is set to a card or ID that can specify a user. For more information on <Cmd sid='team.user.permission.privateAuthMode' />, refer to the [following document](set-permission#privateAuthMode).

* Set an appropriate security level. Higher security levels might lead to lower fingerprint authentication rates or increased false rejection rates (FRR).
:::

## Fingerprint Enrollment {#enroll-fingerprint}

User fingerprints can be enrolled for authentication purposes. Use a device that supports fingerprint authentication to register fingerprint information. Fingerprints can be scanned on devices with a fingerprint scanner.

:::note
**Before enrolling fingerprints…**
* Ensure the user's fingerprints are clean and dry.
* Do not register fingers with wounds or faint fingerprints.
:::

In the <Cmd sid='team.user.credential.title' /> section, click the <IcAdd/> button for the <Cmd sid='team.user.credential.fingerprint.title' /> item.
