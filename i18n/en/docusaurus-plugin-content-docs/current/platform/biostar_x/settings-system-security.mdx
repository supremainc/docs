Configure the security settings of **BioStar X** according to your organization's security policy. You can selectively set password policy, personal data encryption, communication security between devices, and concurrent access control.

:::info

Check your organization's security policy and regulations before enhancing system security.

:::

## Use system security

1. Click <Cmd sid='shell.header.setting' /> on the <Cmd sid='shell.header.launcher' /> page.

2. Click <Cmd sid='setting.menu.system.root' /> → <Cmd sid="setting.systemSecurity" product='2' /> on the left sidebar.

3. Set each item related to security.

   * <Cmd sid='setting.systemSecurity.loginPassword' product='2' />: Set the security level related to login password. For more information, refer to [the following section](#password-policy-configuration).

   * <Cmd sid='setting.server.secure.comm.title' product='2' />: Enhance communication security between personal information and devices. For more information, refer to [the following section](#advanced-security-configuration).

   * <Cmd sid='setting.systemSecurity.sessionSecurity' product='2' />: Enhance session security. For more information, refer to [the following section](#session-security-configuration).

4. Click <Cmd sid="button.apply" product='2' /> at the bottom right of the screen to save your settings.

:::info

Only the first administrator account with ID **1** can use the <Cmd sid="setting.server.secure.comm.title" product='2' /> menu.

:::

## Set password policy {#password-policy-configuration}

The <Cmd sid='setting.systemSecurity.loginPassword' product='2' /> section sets the security level related to the login password. Set the password policy according to your organization's security requirements.

### Set password complexity

You can set the complexity of user passwords. Adjust the slider for the <Cmd sid="setting.server.passwordLevel" product='2' /> option to set the security level.

* <Cmd sid="setting.server.passwordLevelDefault" product='2' />: You can enter up to 32 characters.

* <Cmd sid="setting.server.passwordLevelMedium" product='2' />: When setting a password, a combination of 8 to 32 alphabetic characters (uppercase or lowercase) and numbers is required.

* <Cmd sid="setting.server.passwordLevelStrong" product='2' />: When setting a password, a combination of 10 to 32 alphabetic characters (uppercase and lowercase, including at least one uppercase letter), numbers, and special characters is required.

### Set password change cycle

To limit the usage period of passwords, toggle the button in the <Cmd sid="setting.systemSecurity.passwordUpdateCycle" product='2' /> option to <Cmd sid="common.active" product='2' /> state. Users must change their password periodically as set. If the password change cycle is exceeded, a password change request message will appear during login.

:::info

It can be set from 1 to 180 days.

:::

### Set login failure limit

You can set the number of allowed password input failures and the login restriction time. If you exceed the number of attempts set in the <Cmd sid="setting.systemSecurity.allowLoginFailed" product='2' /> option, you cannot log in for a limited time after incorrectly entering the password.

:::info

This option is activated by default, and login is restricted for 10 minutes after 100 failures. You can adjust the values or disable them as needed.

:::

### Set password change limit

To limit the number of password changes a user can make in a day, toggle the button in the <Cmd sid="setting.systemSecurity.allowPasswordChange" product='2' /> option to <Cmd sid="common.active" product='2' /> state. Users can change the password up to the specified number of times.

:::info

It can be set to a maximum of 10 times.

:::

## Advanced security settings {#advanced-security-configuration}

In the <Cmd sid='setting.server.secure.comm.title' product='2' /> section, you can enhance personal information and communication security between devices.

### Enhance personal data protection

To minimize the risk of data breaches, set the options below to encrypt sensitive personal information.

* <Cmd sid="setting.sever.secure.comm.encrypt.db" product='2' />

  * <Cmd sid="common.use" product='2' />: Encrypt and store user personal data, including credential data.

  * <Cmd sid="common.notUse" product='2' />: Store user personal information without encryption. Data that is already encrypted will be stored decrypted, and new data will not be encrypted.

* <Cmd sid="setting.server.secure.comm.encryption_key_db" product='2' />: Used to encrypt or decrypt information stored in the database to securely protect user personal information. Click the <Cmd sid="setting.server.secure.comm.key_change" product='2' /> button and set a new encryption key value. Changing the encryption key re-encrypts the data that was previously encrypted.

:::info

* Do not forcefully start the server during the personal data DB encryption or decryption process. Errors such as login failure or data corruption may occur. It may take some time depending on the size of the database and the performance of the server.

* <Cmd sid="setting.server.secure.comm.encryption_key_db" product='2' /> can be entered using alphanumeric characters and symbols for a total of 32 characters.

### Set communication security between devices

Set up secure communication between the **BioStar X** server and access control devices.

* <Cmd sid="setting.sever.secure.comm.menu" product='2' />: Communication between the **BioStar X** server and access control devices can be protected with certificates. If you set this option to <Cmd sid="common.use" product='2' />, the server automatically generates a certificate to send to the devices, and all communication is encrypted thereafter. Devices can use this certificate to establish a secure channel when exchanging data with the **BioStar X** server.

  To use external certificates, enable the <Cmd sid='setting.sever.secure.comm.extcert.menu' product='2' /> option and upload the root certificate, public key certificate, and private key file.

  <Image src='/img/biostarx-settings-system-security-advanced-with-device.png' />
* <Cmd sid="setting.server.secure.comm.data_encryption" product='2' />: You can redefine the data encryption key and administrator password.

:::info

* **BioStar X** generates or deletes certificates according to the configuration status of device and secure communication settings, and does not recreate the same certificate as before. For example, if the setting of Secure communication with device is changed in the order of <Cmd sid="common.use" product='2' /> → <Cmd sid="common.notUse" product='2' />, the created certificate will be deleted automatically. When the setting is changed in the order of <Cmd sid="common.use" product='2' /> → <Cmd sid="common.notUse" product='2' /> → <Cmd sid="common.use" product='2' />, the operation of **Create A certificate** → **Delete A certificate** → **Create B certificate** is carried out.

* If you set the <Cmd sid="setting.sever.secure.comm.menu" product='2' /> option to <Cmd sid="common.notUse" product='2' /> while the device is physically separated from the network, the certificate stored in the device will be deleted. In this case, the device cannot be reconnected. To connect it again, the certificate saved in the device must be deleted or the device must be reset to factory default. For more information, refer to the manual of the device.

## Concurrent access control {#session-security-configuration}

In the <Cmd sid='setting.systemSecurity.sessionSecurity' product='2' /> section, you can limit duplicate logins for the same account to enhance security. Set the <Cmd sid="setting.systemSecurity.useSimultaneousConnection" product='2' /> option to <Cmd sid="common.inactive" product='2' />. When there are concurrent login attempts for the same account, existing users logged in will be logged out.
