* <Cmd sid="setting.sever.secure.comm.menu" product='2' />: The communication between BioStar X and a device can be protected using a certificate.<br/>When <Cmd sid="common.use" product='2' /> is set for <Cmd sid="setting.sever.secure.comm.menu" product='2' />, BioStar X creates and sends a certificate to the device. The device can use a secure channel for exchanging data with BioStar X using this certificate. In order to use an external certificate, Root certificate, Public key certificate, and Private key files must be uploaded.<br/>If <Cmd sid="setting.server.secure.comm.data_encryption" product='2' /> set to <Cmd sid="common.use" product='2' />, you can set a new data encryption key and administrator password.

    :::info

    <details>
    <summary>The devices and firmware versions where <Cmd sid="setting.sever.secure.comm.menu" product='2' /> can be set are as follows.</summary>

    * FaceStation 2 FW 1.1.0 or later

    * BioStation A2 FW 1.5.0 or later

    * BioStar X creates or deletes a certificate according to the setting status of Secure communication with device, and the same certificate as the previous certificate will not be created. For example, if the setting of Secure communication with device is changed in the order of <Cmd sid="common.use" product='2' /> → <Cmd sid="common.notUse" product='2' />, the created certificate will be deleted automatically. When the setting is changed in the order of <Cmd sid="common.use" product='2' /> → <Cmd sid="common.notUse" product='2' /> → <Cmd sid="common.use" product='2' />, the operation of **Create A certificate** → **Delete A certificate** → **Create B certificate** is carried out.

    * If the device is disconnected from the network physically while using the secure communication of BioStar X, do not turn off the secure communication option. In such a case, the certificate of BioStar X will be deleted, and the device will not be able to connect again. To connect it again, the certificate saved in the device must be deleted or the device must be reset to factory default. For more details, refer to the manual of the device.
