Click the issuance status on the left side of the screen to filter by card issuance status. The card issuance statuses are as follows:

* <Cmd sid='setting.card.unassignedCard' product='2' />: Card that is not assigned to any user.

* <Cmd sid='setting.card.assignedCard' product='2' />: Card assigned to a specific user. You can check the ID and name of the assigned user on the card list.

* <Cmd sid='setting.card.blacklistCard' product='2' />: Card registered on the blacklist. The cardholder cannot authenticate for access.

* <Cmd sid='setting.card.deletedCsnMobileCard' product='2' />: Deleted mobile access card.

## CSN Mobile Card Deletion Management Guidelines

When using CSN mobile cards integrated with the Airfob Portal Regular Site in **BioStar X**, if a user deletes a card, the same card ID could be reissued to another user. However, this could lead to an issue where the original cardholder could still access the premises even after the card has been reissued.

To address this issue, **BioStar X** provides the feature to manage deletion history after deleting CSN mobile cards.

### Separate management of deleted CSN mobile cards

Deleted CSN mobile cards are recorded in the <Cmd sid='common.setting' product='2' /> → <Cmd sid='common.card' product='2' /> → <Cmd sid='setting.card.deletedCsnMobileCard' product='2' /> list. In this list, you can view the <Cmd sid='setting.card.cardType' product='2' />, <Cmd sid='user.cardList.th.cardFormat' product='2' />, <Cmd sid='setting.card.cardId' product='2' />, and <Cmd sid='setting.card.lastCardHolder' product='2' />.

### Preventing reissuance of deleted card IDs

If there is a history of deletion for a CSN mobile card, the system will prevent that card ID from being reissued to another user.

If you wish to issue a card with a deleted card ID, you can only do so after excluding the corresponding CSN mobile card from the <Cmd sid='setting.card.deletedCsnMobileCard' product='2' /> list.

:::info

CSN mobile cards included in the <Cmd sid='setting.card.deletedCsnMobileCard' product='2' /> list cannot be deleted from the <Cmd sid='setting.card.unassignedCard' product='2' /> list.

To delete a card from the <Cmd sid='setting.card.unassignedCard' product='2' /> list, first remove the card from the <Cmd sid='setting.card.deletedCsnMobileCard' product='2' /> list and then proceed with the deletion.
