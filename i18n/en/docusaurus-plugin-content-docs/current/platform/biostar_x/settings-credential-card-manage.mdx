Click the issuance status on the left side of the screen to filter by card issuance status. The card issuance statuses are as follows:

* <Cmd sid='setting.card.unassignedCard' product='2' />: Card that is not assigned to any user.

* <Cmd sid='setting.card.assignedCard' product='2' />: Card assigned to a specific user. You can check the ID and name of the assigned user on the card list.

* <Cmd sid='setting.card.blacklistCard' product='2' />: Card registered on the blacklist. The cardholder cannot authenticate for access.

* <Cmd sid='setting.card.deletedCsnMobileCard' product='2' />: Deleted mobile access card. This card can no longer be used.
