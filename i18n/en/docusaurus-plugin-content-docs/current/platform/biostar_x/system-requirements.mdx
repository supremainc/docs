**BioStar X** provides a reliable and scalable integrated security management solution for large enterprise environments. The system can efficiently manage over a thousand devices through a distributed architecture consisting of a main server and a communication server.

The main server manages the core management features of the system, while the communication server is responsible for device communication, distributing the load and optimizing performance. Additionally, administrators can access the system via a web browser on client PCs and perform all management tasks. Check the system requirements below to configure the optimal environment for your organization size.
