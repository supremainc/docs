This guide explains how to monitor and control the real-time status of doors and cameras by zone and floor using the map monitoring feature. Map monitoring allows for easy navigation of areas and floors through a visual interface integrated with Google Maps, enabling various features such as access door control and camera video playback.

To access the <Cmd sid='arena.title' /> page, click <Cmd sid='arena.title' /> in the <Cmd sid='shell.header.launcher' /> or select <Cmd sid='arena.title' /> from the menu at the top left of the screen.

Multiple facilities can be configured within a single area in **BioStar X**. Each facility can have multiple floors configured. In one floor, you can set up the door and camera based on the drawing for monitoring. Please refer to the below.

![Area structure](/img/common/monitoring-map-area-tree.png)

You can access the configured area on the GIS map in the order of Area → Facility → Floor, as shown in the image, to monitor and control doors and cameras. This structure can also be seen in the sidebar of the <Cmd sid='arena.title' /> page.
