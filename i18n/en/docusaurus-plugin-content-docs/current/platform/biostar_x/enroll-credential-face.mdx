You can enroll the user's face as a means of authentication for access control. Face enrollment is an authentication method that captures the user's face using a visual camera. This is distinct from face captured by an infrared camera and can only be used with devices that support visual face. Face captured by the visual camera can also be enrolled remotely on mobile devices.
