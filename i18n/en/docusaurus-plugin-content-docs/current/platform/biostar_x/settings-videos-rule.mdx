Rules are settings to send events and bookmarks to the VMS server by combining events that occur at the camera and door. Proper video rule settings enable the utilization of various security management features.

* **Automatic bookmark creation**: Automatically create bookmarks when specific access events occur to easily find important videos.

* **Efficient monitoring**: Monitor live footage from cameras connected to doors and check events instantly when they occur.

* **Integrated event management**: Link access events and footage to comprehensively understand security situations.

:::info

The video rule feature is available with an **Advanced** license or higher through additional options. For more information on licensing policy, refer to [the following](licensing#features-add-ons).
