Rules are settings to send events and bookmarks to the VMS server by combining events that occur at the camera and door. Through proper camera rule settings, you can utilize the following security management features.

* **Automatic bookmark creation**: Automatically create bookmarks when specific access events occur to easily find important videos.

* **Efficient monitoring**: Monitor live footage from cameras connected to doors and check events instantly when they occur.

* **Integrated event management**: Link access events and footage to comprehensively understand security situations.

:::info

The camera rule feature can be used with additional options in the **Advanced** license or higher. For more information on licensing policy, refer to [the following](licensing#features-add-ons).
