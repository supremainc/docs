:::info

* The available network options may differ depending on the device type.

* If the user has made any arbitrary changes, click the <Cmd sid='button.apply' product='2' /> button. Changes will not be applied to the device if not saved.

:::

## TCP/IP settings

In the <Cmd sid='device.info.tcpIpSetting' product='2' /> group, you can set the device's IP address.

:::info

For more information about IP address settings during device registration, refer to the [following](settings-adding-devices#setipaddress).

:::

### Dynamic IP settings

To configure the device to use a dynamic IP, select the <Cmd sid='device.info.useDhcp' product='2' /> group. The device will automatically receive an IP address from the DHCP server, which may change.

### Static IP settings

To set a static IP address for the device, deselect the <Cmd sid='device.info.useDhcp' product='2' /> group. You can enter the following network information:

* <Cmd sid='device.info.ipdOsdpID' product='2' />: Enter the OSDP address of the device. This should be a number between 0 and 126.

* <Cmd sid='device.info.subnetMask' product='2' />: Enter the device's subnet mask.

* <Cmd sid='device.info.gateway' product='2' />: Enter the device's gateway address.

* <Cmd sid='device.info.devicePort' product='2' />: Enter the device's port number.

* <Cmd sid='device.info.dnsServerAddress' product='2' />: Enter the device's DNS server address.

:::info

Refer to the following devices that support wireless LAN settings:

* BioStation 2

* BioStation A2

* FaceStation 2

* [BioStation 3](../../device/biostation_3/settings#wireless)

:::

## Server communication settings

In the <Cmd sid='device.info.server' product='2' /> group, you can configure how the device communicates with the **BioStar X** server.

* <Cmd sid='device.info.deviceToServerConnection' product='2' />: Selecting this option allows you to enter the IP address and port number of the **BioStar X** server the device will connect to.

* <Cmd sid='device.info.serverIP' product='2' />: Enter the IP address or domain name of the **BioStar X** server.

* <Cmd sid='device.info.serverPort' product='2' />: Enter the port number of the **BioStar X** server.

:::tip

This feature is useful when the IP address of the **BioStar X** server changes. By pre-configuring this option on multiple devices before changing the server's IP address, the devices will automatically connect to the updated IP address.

## Intelligent slave settings

In the <Cmd sid='device.info.intelligentPD' product='2' /> group, when a user authenticates using a fingerprint in an environment where Suprema devices are connected to third-party controllers, the authentication result is sent as Open Supervised Device Protocol (OSDP) card data to support numerous 1:1 or 1:N matching.

* <Cmd sid='device.info.ipdUseFailCode' product='2' />: When using the intelligent slave, if an exception occurs such as authentication failure, enter the exception code in decimal (0~18446744073709551615) or hexadecimal (0~FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF) format to record an accurate log. Hexadecimal can be input using numbers or letters.
