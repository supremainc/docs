* Do not enroll fingerprints that are injured or blurry.

* <Cmd sid='common.device' product='2' />: Select the device for enrolling the fingerprint.

* <Cmd sid='common.quality' product='2' />: You can adjust the fingerprint enrollment quality. If the quality does not meet the required level, fingerprint cannot be enrolled.

* <Cmd sid='user.viewImage' product='2' />: The original image of the scanned fingerprint can be viewed in area <Num num='1' />.

* <Cmd sid='button.addplus' product='2' />: Click the button to add a fingerprint. A maximum of 10 fingerprints can be enrolled.

* <Cmd sid='button.scan' product='2' />: Click the button to scan the fingerprint and place your finger on the fingerprint scanner or device sensor.

* <Cmd sid='button.delete' product='2' />: This allows deleting an enrolled fingerprint. To delete a fingerprint, select the respective fingerprint number and click the button.

* <Cmd sid='button.chkDuplicated' product='2' />: Confirm if it is a previously enrolled fingerprint through [Server Matching](../../reference/glossary#server_matching).

* <Cmd sid='user.duress' product='2' />: To enroll a fingerprint as a [duress fingerprint](../../reference/glossary#duress), select this option and scan the fingerprint. This fingerprint can be used to send alerts in situations where you are threatened or must open a door under duress.

:::info

* Do not use a duress fingerprint for everyday access.

* When activating the <Cmd sid='user.viewImage' product='2' /> option, you can view the fingerprint image, but it is not stored in **BioStar**.

* If the fingerprint authentication rate is low, delete the fingerprint and enroll a new fingerprint.

* To achieve good quality fingerprint, ensure your finger covers the entire surface of the fingerprint recognition sensor. Use the fingerprints of the index or middle finger.
