You can set emergency open permissions to allow specific users to access all doors in emergency situations. If a door is opened with a card that has emergency access permission set, that door remains open, allowing anyone to enter.

## Before start

You must first add the card credentials before setting the emergency open permissions. For more information on how to add card credentials, refer to [the following](enroll-credential-card).
