Devices connected to **BioStar X** can easily upgrade their firmware without additional connections or operations. Keeping the device firmware up to date resolves security vulnerabilities and allows access to new features.

## Before start {#before-starting}

Before upgrading the device firmware, prepare the new version of the firmware file. Save the downloaded firmware file in the following path. Create a new folder if the *firmware* folder does not exist.

* 32-bit operating system: *C:\Program Files\BioStar X\firmware*

* 64-bit operating system: *C:\Program Files\BioStar X\firmware*

Search for your device model name on the [Suprema Download Center](https://download.supremainc.com) to download the latest version of the firmware file.
