This guide explains how to set user access permissions. Users can set which spaces they can access and what times they can access them through access permissions. Access permissions can be set when adding or modifying a user.

Go to the <Cmd sid='shell.header.user' /> page and set access permissions using the two methods below.

import EnterUserPage from '../../common/_enter-user-page.mdx';

<EnterUserPage />

The items that can be configured in the <Cmd sid='common.permission' product='2' /> section are as follows. Refer to the descriptions for each item to set appropriate user permissions.

## Select operator level {#operatorLevel}

Menu access will be limited based on operator level. Select the operator level in the <Cmd sid='common.permission' product='2' /> section under <Cmd sid='user.bioStarOperator' product='2' />. Please refer to the list below for the permission levels that can be assigned to users.

import AccountList from '../../common/_account-list.mdx';

<AccountList />


## Login settings with user IP address {#userIp}

If you register a user IP address, you can log in to the PC only when the IP information matches the one registered to your account. This enhances security. Enter the user's IP address in the <Cmd sid='common.permission' product='2' /> section under <Cmd sid='user.ip' product='2' />.

:::info

* IP addresses can be entered in the format xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx, and each octet must contain a number in the range of 0â€“255.

* If the IP address is not registered, PC login will be allowed regardless of IP information.

* When using the cloud, access can be granted without matching the registered IP address to the PC's IP address.

## Select access group {#accessGroup}

Set the user's access group to restrict access by organization or department. Select an access group in the <Cmd sid='common.permission' product='2' /> section under <Cmd sid='team.user.permission.accessGroup' />.
