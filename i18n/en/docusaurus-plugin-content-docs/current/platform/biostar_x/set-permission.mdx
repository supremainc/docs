According to the organization's security policy, you can differentiate user-specific operational privileges and access permissions for **BioStar X**. Restrict access to main menus through administrator levels and control access to physical spaces through access groups. You can also enhance security through IP address restrictions and multi-factor authentication.

Go to the <Cmd sid='shell.header.user' /> page and set access permissions using the two methods below.

import EnterUserPage from '../../common/_enter-user-page.mdx';

<EnterUserPage />

In the <Cmd sid='team.user.permission.title' /> section, the following items can be set. Refer to the descriptions for each item to set appropriate user permissions.

## Select administrator level {#operatorLevel}

The menus accessible will be limited based on the selected administrator level. Select the user's administrator level in the <Cmd sid='team.user.permission.title' /> section, under the <Cmd sid='user.bioStarOperator' product='2' /> item. Refer to the list below for the administrator levels that can be assigned to users.

import AccountList from '../../common/_account-list.mdx';

<AccountList />

### Set login ID and password

If you selected an administrator level, you must set the ID and password to be used when the user logs in to **BioStar X**.

:::info

**Precautions when setting ID and password**

* Set the ID to a combination of letters and numbers between 8 and 32 characters.

* For more information on password policy configuration, refer to [the following](settings-system-security#password-policy-configuration).

* Avoid using passwords that are vulnerable to security.

  * Consecutive characters or numbers (e.g., abcd, 1234)

  * Common words or patterns (e.g., qwerty, password)

:::

## Multi-Factor Authentication Setting {#multiFactorAuth}

Enabling <Cmd sid='common.fingerprintLogin' product='2' /> allows users to log into **BioStar X** with added fingerprint authentication.

:::info

For more information about the multi-factor authentication settings, refer to [this document](login-with-mfa).

:::

## Login settings with user IP address {#userIp}

If you register a user IP address, you can log in to the PC only when the IP information matches the one registered to your account. This enhances security. Enter the user's IP address in the <Cmd sid='team.user.permission.userIp' /> field of the <Cmd sid='team.user.permission.title' /> section.

:::info

* IP addresses can be entered in the format xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx, and each octet must contain a number in the range of 0â€“255.

* If the IP address is not registered, PC login will be allowed regardless of IP information.

:::

## Select access group {#accessGroup}

Set the user's access group to restrict access by organization or department. In the <Cmd sid='team.user.permission.title' /> section, select the access group from <Cmd sid='team.user.permission.accessGroup' />.

:::info

For more information about adding and managing access groups, refer to [the following](settings-access-control-manage-access-group).
