Remote access via ngrok allows secure access to internal networks from external networks. This feature enables access to the **BioStar X** server remotely without firewall settings or port forwarding.

:::info

* The remote access feature is available as an additional option for **Advanced** licenses and above. For more information on licensing policy, refer to [the following](licensing#features-add-ons).

* When purchasing the remote access license, Suprema generates a bot account, endpoint, and license document for remote access use on the ngrok Suprema site.

:::

:::caution

* The remote access feature is provided through tunneling by the third-party service, ngrok.

* BioStar X simply supports the connection by calling the ngrok API, but the security, safety, and continuity of internet connectivity entirely depend on the ngrok service. Therefore, Suprema assumes no responsibility for any security incidents, data loss, or system breaches that may occur during the use of this feature.

## When to use this?

Use the remote access feature in the following situations.

* When you need to connect to the **BioStar X** server from an external network

* When it's challenging to connect directly due to firewalls or NAT environments

* When you want to quickly set up remote access without complex network setups

* When you need to temporarily provide outside access rights
