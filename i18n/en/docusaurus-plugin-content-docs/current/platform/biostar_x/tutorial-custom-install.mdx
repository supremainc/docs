This guides the user on how to set up a <Cmd code='biostar2.install.customInstall' className='bold'/> to integrate with a database that the user has already installed.

:::info

* The databases that can be used in integration with **BioStar X** are as follows.

  * MariaDB 10.1.10

  * MS SQL Server 2012 SP3

  * MS SQL Server 2014 SP2

  * MS SQL Server 2016 SP1

  * MS SQL Server 2017

  * MS SQL Server 2019

  * MS SQL Server 2022

* MS SQL Server communication security supports TLS 1.2.

* If the database table creation fails when MS SQL Server is set as the Database Type, you can create the table by executing the script in *C:\Program Files\BioStar X\dbscript\mssql* folder.

* When installing with <Cmd code='biostar2.install.customInstall' className='bold'/>, **AC DB name**, **TA DB name**, and **VE DB name** cannot be set the same.

* To use Windows authentication, [Microsoft ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/odbc/download-odbc-driver-for-sql-server?view=sql-server-ver16#version-17) is required.
  Please install the driver first.
