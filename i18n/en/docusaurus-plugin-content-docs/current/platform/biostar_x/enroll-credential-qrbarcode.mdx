1. Click <Cmd sid='button.addQr' product='2' /> in the <Cmd sid='common.credential' product='2' /> section.

3. Select <Cmd sid='zone.intrusion.inputType' product='2' />.

   * <Cmd sid='user.random.cardid' product='2' />: Automatically generate a card ID.

   * <Cmd sid='user.manual.input' product='2' />: Enter the card ID manually.

4. Click the <Cmd sid='button.enroll' product='2' /> button.

Then, when a user authenticates access, QR codes are issued and sent to the email address registered with user information. The user can scan the QR code included in the email on the device to gain access.

To prevent duplicate card ID creation, it is recommended to set <Cmd sid='zone.intrusion.inputType' product='2' /> to <Cmd sid='user.random.cardid' product='2' />.
