Instructions for checking and setting the server's network priority before installing **BioStar X**.

## When is it needed?

You need to check and set network priority in the following situations.

* When two or more network adapters are installed on the server

* When a specific network adapter must be used for the **BioStar X** service

* To prevent network connection issues after installing **BioStar X**

:::info

If none of the above situations apply, there is no need to change the network priority. Skip this step and proceed with the installation of **BioStar X**. For more information on installing **BioStar X**, refer to [the following](express-install).

:::

:::warning

A network adapter with a lower metric (higher priority) will be automatically selected during the installation of **BioStar X**. Since it may be difficult to change this setting after installation, be sure to check and adjust the network priority before installation.

## Check Network Priority

### Check in command prompt

1. Search for `cmd` in the **Start** menu and run **Command Prompt**.

2. Enter the following command.

   ```cmd
   route print
   ```

3. Look for entries in the **IPv4 Route Table** section where **Network Destination** is `0.0.0.0`.

4. Check the value in the **Metric** column. The lower the value, the higher the priority.

Example output:

In the above example, the `192.168.40.123` interface has a metric value of **20**, resulting in a higher priority.

### Check network adapter information

Verify which network adapter corresponds to each interface.

1. In the **Command Prompt** window, enter the command below.

   ```cmd
   ipconfig /all
   ```

2. Match each network adapter's **IPv4 address** with the **Gateway** address identified earlier to identify which adapter it is.

## Change network priority

To raise the priority of the desired network adapter, follow the steps below.

The following steps are based on Windows 11. The menu location may vary depending on the version of Windows you are using.

### Metric settings

1. Uncheck the **Automatic Metric** checkbox.

2. Enter the desired value in the **Interface Metric** field.

   * If you want the highest priority, enter `1`.

   * If you want a higher priority than other adapters, enter a number smaller than the metric values of other adapters.

3. To save the settings and close all windows, click the **OK** button.

:::info

The values you can enter for **Interface Metric** range from `1` to `9999`. The lower the value, the higher the priority.

</Step>
<Step>

### Check settings

1. Reopen **Command Prompt** and execute the `route print` command.

2. Check whether the metric value has changed.

</Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

* If the settings are not applied, restart your computer or disable and then re-enable the network adapter.

* If the network connection is lost, revert to the original settings and re-enable the **Automatic Metric** option. Contact your network administrator to verify the correct settings.

:::info

If you need to change network settings after installing **BioStar X**, it's recommended to completely uninstall the program and then reinstall it.
