   :::note

   * Check the access address of **BioStar X** in the web browser's address bar.

   * If you installed **BioStar X** on another PC, enter the IP address of that PC. e.g. `https://192.168.0.1`

   * Do not use 'localhost' as the **BioStar X** access address.

   * **BioStar X** processes all requests through the Unified Gateway. Thus, web access and API calls are made through the Unified Gateway port (default 443).

3. When the login screen appears, log in with the administrator account.

   * The admin ID is **admin**. 

   * If you see a **Not Secure** warning in the web browser's address bar, you need to install the HTTPS certificate. For more information on installing the certificate, refer to [the following](settings-server-https).
