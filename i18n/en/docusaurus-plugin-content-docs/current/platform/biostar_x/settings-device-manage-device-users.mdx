You can check the number of users, fingerprints, faces, and cards stored on the device. Information about users not registered on **BioStar X** can be compared with registered user information, and you can send or delete this information on the **BioStar X** server.

1. Click <Cmd sid='shell.header.setting' /> on the <Cmd sid='shell.header.launcher' /> page.

2. Click <Cmd sid='setting.menu.device.root' /> in the left sidebar.

3. Select the device from the <Cmd sid='menu.device.allDeviceGroups' product='2' /> list and right-click.

4. Click <Cmd sid='button.manageUsersInDevice' product='2' /> from the pop-up menu.

When the <Cmd sid='device.menu.manageUsersInDevice' product='2' /> window appears, you can compare the user information registered on the device with the user information registered on **BioStar X**.

Refer to the values displayed in the <Cmd sid='common.status' product='2' /> column to choose whether to delete user information from the device or send it to the **BioStar X** server. The values in the <Cmd sid='common.status' product='2' /> column are as follows:

* <Cmd sid='user.syncStatus.same' product='2' />: User with the same information registered on the **BioStar X** server

* <Cmd sid='user.syncStatus.different' product='2' />: User with information different from that registered on the **BioStar X** server

* <Cmd sid='user.syncStatus.newUser' product='2' />: **BioStar X** user not stored on the server

To delete specific user information from the device, select the user to delete and click the <Cmd sid='button.delete' product='2' /> button. To send user information to the **BioStar X** server, click the <Cmd sid='button.upload' product='2' /> button.

:::info

* The <Cmd sid='button.manageUsersInDevice' product='2' /> feature can only be used with one device selected.

* When clicking the <Cmd sid='button.upload' product='2' /> button, if there is a user on the **BioStar X** server with the same ID, it can be updated with the deviceâ€™s information.

* Deleted user information is removed only from the device and will be retained on the **BioStar X** server.

* For more information about the device's settings, refer to [the following](settings-device-details).
