This guide explains how to configure the attendance management rules by setting the work schedule in hourly, daily, and weekly units.

If this is your first time registering working rules, follow the steps below to configure it.

<Steps>
<Step>

## <Cmd sid='tab.payCode' product='2' className='bold' />

You can set time rules for attendance record management, overtime, and absences. You can set hourly weights and can color code them for easy identification.

For more information on <Cmd sid='tab.payCode' product='2' className='normal' /> settings, refer to [the following](tna-rule-shift-paycode).

</Step>
<Step>

## <Cmd sid='tab.shift' product='2' className='bold' />

You can set daily working rules based on a 24-hour period. Working rules include time rule settings based on time, daily start time settings, and time rounding rules.

For more information on <Cmd sid='tab.shift' product='2' className='normal' /> settings, refer to [the following](tna-rule-shift-day).

</Step>
<Step>

## <Cmd sid='tab.scheduleTemplate' product='2' className='bold' />

You can set weekly work rules based on the daily work rules configured. You can set weekly work rules on a weekly or daily basis.

For more information on <Cmd sid='tab.scheduleTemplate' product='2' className='normal' /> settings, refer to [the following](tna-rule-shift-schedule).

</Step>
<Step>

## <Cmd sid='rule.rule' product='2' className='bold' />

This can be useful when you have not added overtime rules to the daily working rules. The overtime set in daily working rules has start and end times, but <Cmd sid='rule.rule' product='2' /> calculates the total time exceeding the regular working hours. <Cmd sid='rule.rule' product='2' /> can be conveniently used when managing the total overtime hours daily/weekly/monthly, and if you set <Cmd sid='rule.rule' product='2' />, it will apply instead of the overtime rule added to the working rules.

For more information on <Cmd sid='rule.rule' product='2' className='normal' /> settings, refer to [the following](tna-rule-shift-overtime).

</Step>
<Step>

## Work schedule

You can set the period to apply the working schedule configured in the previous step, along with users, other working rules, and leave schedules.

For more information on <Cmd sid='ta.schedule' product='2' className='normal' /> settings, refer to [the following](tna-rule-schedule).
