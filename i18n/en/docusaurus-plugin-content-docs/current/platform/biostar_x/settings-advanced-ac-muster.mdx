The muster is a necessary setting for effective personnel management and safety assurance during emergencies. This feature allows administrators to designate a specific location as a gathering point to predefine where users will gather during emergencies.

The muster setting serves the following purposes:

* **Emergency response**: Designate a location where users can safely gather in case of emergencies, such as fires or earthquakes.

* **Personnel monitoring**: Check the current number of people and the list of entrants in real-time in a specific location.

* **Long stay detection**: Detect users remaining in a specific location beyond the set time and send notifications to the administrator.

* **Enhanced security**: Continuously monitor access to sensitive locations to improve security levels.

Through these features, administrators can establish a more systematic and efficient security management framework.
