The muster zone is a necessary setting for effective personnel management and safety assurance during emergencies. This feature allows administrators to designate specific areas as muster points, predefining locations where users can gather in emergency situations.

The muster zone setting serves the following purposes:

- **Emergency response**: Designate areas where users can safely gather during emergencies such as fires or earthquakes.
  
- **Personnel monitoring**: Check the current number of individuals in specific zones and view the entry list in real-time.

- **Long stay detection**: Detect users staying in specific zones longer than the set time and send notifications to the administrator.

- **Enhanced security**: Continuously monitor access to sensitive areas to improve security levels.

Through these features, administrators can establish a more systematic and efficient security management framework.
