This section describes how to enter basic user information. The entered user information is used for search and management. Managing user information clearly helps comply with the organization's security and privacy policies.

* When you systematically enter basic information such as name, department, position, and group, you can easily search for, classify, and manage users.

* You can refine the access rights based on the user's affiliation, position, and group information.

* It is advantageous for security and auditing because it allows for accurate tracking of activities, access logs, etc. by user.

Go to the <Cmd sid='shell.header.launcher' /> → <Cmd sid='shell.header.user' /> page. You can enter user information in the two ways below.

import EnterUserPage from '../../common/_enter-user-page.mdx';
