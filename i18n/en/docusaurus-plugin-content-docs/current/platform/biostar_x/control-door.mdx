This guide describes how to control doors. You can lock the door for a certain period of time, check the camera connected to the door and clear alarms that have occurred.

* Control the door remotely to manage access. You can set the door to be open or locked for a specific period of time.

* You can monitor access situations in real-time through the camera connected to the door.

* The [anti-passback](../../reference/glossary#apb) feature prevents unauthorized access and accurately manages access logs.

Click <Cmd sid='shell.header.arena' /> on the <Cmd sid='shell.header.launcher' /> page or select <Cmd sid='shell.header.arena' /> from the shortcut list at the top left of the screen. Select the door you want to control and right-click. You can select the desired feature from the popup menu.
