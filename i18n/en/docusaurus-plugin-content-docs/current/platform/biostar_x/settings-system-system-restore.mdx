You can restore using a system backup file when there is an issue with **BioStar X** or you need to revert to a previous state. The restore feature enables you to return the database, various settings, and license information to the state at the time of backup.

:::caution

* Proceeding with the restore operation returns the current data to the backup point. It is recommended to create a backup of the current state before restoring. To create a backup of the current state, refer to [the following](settings-system-system-backup).

* If the server IP address of the restore target differs from the backup server IP address during the restore operation, the restore process may fail. Verify the server IP address before proceeding with the restore operation.

:::info

If the SQL Server database and **BioStar X** are installed on different servers, you cannot use **BioStar X** system backup and restore.

:::

1. In Windows, run <Start/> → **BioStar X** → **BioStar X Restore**.

   * Program path: *C:\Program Files\BioStar X\biostar-restore.exe*

2. Click the **Select File** button and choose the backup file to restore.

3. To start the restoration, click the **Restore** button. 

When the message **Starting Biostar services...Done** appears, the restoration is complete. Access **BioStar X** to verify the restored data.

:::info

* Restoration cannot proceed if the version of **BioStar X** at the time of the backup is different from the current version. To check the version of **BioStar X**, click the <IcInfo /> button at the top right of the screen.
