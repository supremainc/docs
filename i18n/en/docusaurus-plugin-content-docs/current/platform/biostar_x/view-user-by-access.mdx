## Learn about the tree structure {#learn-tree-view}

The tree structure menu is composed of the following structure.

<Treeview />

* **Access group** is the upper layer that includes access levels, floor levels, user groups, and users. You can manage access permissions through the **access group**. For more information on creating access groups, refer to [the following](settings-access-control-manage-access-group).

* **Access level** sets the times when users can enter and grants permission to access doors during this time. For more information on creating access levels, refer to [the following](settings-access-control-manage-access-level).

* You can manage the floors users can access via elevators through the **floor level**. For more information on creating floor levels, refer to [the following](settings-access-control-manage-floor-level).

* **Schedule** is a feature that efficiently operates access control and attendance management by setting access and holiday schedules. For more information on registering schedules, refer to [the following](settings-schedule).

* You can register elevators and manage the floors accessible via the elevators. For more information about elevator enrollment, refer to [the following](settings-elevators-add).
