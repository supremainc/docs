By using the virtual device feature, you can log events such as clock-in and clock-out directly to **BioStar X** from mobile apps or third-party services when integrating the attendance management feature. You can systematically manage event logs without a physical device, which is useful for integration with external systems.

## When to use this?

Use the virtual device event log integration feature in the following situations.

* When managing events from the external T&A management system in **BioStar X**

* When you need to save access logs (Punch Log) from the mobile app or external system directly to **BioStar X** (recording check-in/check-out events without database linkage)

* When you need to send events directly via the **BioStar X** API from third-party applications or services

## Before start

The **Event Log API** license must be activated. For more information on licensing policy, refer to [the following](licensing#features-add-ons).

:::info

For more information on license application, refer to [the following](settings-license-biostar-x-license).

## Register virtual device

1. Click <Cmd sid='shell.header.setting' /> on the <Cmd sid='shell.header.launcher' /> page.

2. Click <Cmd sid='setting.menu.device.root' /> in the left sidebar.

3. Click <IcMoreW /> at the top right of the device list and select <Cmd sid='device.addVirtualDevice' product='2' />.

4. Enter the setting information when the <Cmd sid='device.addVirtualDevice' product='2' /> screen appears.

   <Image src='/img/biostarx-settings-device-add-virtual-device-settings.png' />

   * <Cmd sid='device.info.name' product='2' />: Enter the virtual device's name.

   * <Cmd sid='device.info.group' product='2' />: Select the group to assign the virtual device.

   * <Cmd sid='device.info.deviceId' product='2' />: Enter the unique ID of the virtual device. It must be specified within a range that does not duplicate with the existing device ID.

   * <Cmd sid='common.description' product='2' />: Enter the description for virtual device.

5. Click <Cmd sid='button.apply' product='2' /> at the bottom right of the screen to register the virtual device.

:::info

* <Cmd sid='device.info.deviceId' product='2' /> can be specified within the range of 100000 - 999999. It must be specified within a range that does not duplicate with the existing Suprema device ID.

* The value of <Cmd sid='device.info.deviceId' product='2' /> that has already been created cannot be modified.

:::

### Manage device groups

Virtual devices can use the device group feature just like regular devices.

* You can place it in the same group as existing devices.

* If the user has group permissions, they can grant permissions to virtual devices within that group.

:::info

For more information on device groups, refer to [the following](settings-manage-device-group).

:::

### Virtual device limitations

* Virtual devices appear only in the following menu.

  * <Cmd sid='shell.header.setting' /> â†’ <Cmd sid='setting.menu.device.root' />

  * View all event logs and preview event logs in <Cmd sid='shell.header.arena' />

  * Retrieve event log from <Cmd sid='shell.header.data' />

* The virtual device cannot use access control features at the door and <Cmd sid='setting.menu.advancedAc.root' />.

* Cannot be specified as a device for <Cmd sid='shell.header.tna' product='2' /> setting.

* Virtual devices do not appear in the device list in the sidebar of the <Cmd sid='shell.header.arena' /> menu.

* Cannot use device control feature.

* Not included in the number of devices for the **Multi Communication Server** license.

## Log events via API

### Supported event type

Only the following event types can be recorded.

* **Access granted**

* **Access Denied**

### API parameters

You must provide the following parameters when logging events.

| Parameter  | Description                                       | Required |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| Event Type | Access Granted or Access Denied                   | Yes      |
| Datetime   | Event occurrence time                             | Yes      |
| Device ID  | Only registered virtual device IDs are allowed    | Yes      |
| User ID    | User ID                                           | Yes      |
| T&A key    | Only available for input with the specified value | Option   |

:::info

* You can log multiple event logs for a single virtual device at once with a single API call.

* For more information on using API, refer to [the following](https://bs2api.biostar2.com/).

:::

## Retrieve event log

You can retrieve the event logs recorded through the virtual device in the menu.

* <Cmd sid='shell.header.arena' />: Retrieve and filter all events, event preview

* <Cmd sid='shell.header.data' />: Retrieve and filter all events

:::info

* For more information about event retrieval on <Cmd sid='shell.header.arena' />, refer to [the following](monitoring-event).

* For more information about <Cmd sid='shell.header.data' />, refer to [the following](data-generate-reports).

:::

## Audit trail

Audit trail is recorded as shown in the example below when logs are recorded for events.

```
Access granted, 2025/08/05 03:37:49, outside access door on 12th floor, Administrator(1)
```

:::info

* Even if events are logged in batch, an individual audit trail entry is created for each event.

* For more information on <Cmd sid='setting.menu.system.auditTrail' />, refer to [the following](settings-system-audit-trail).

:::

## Troubleshooting

### If the <Cmd sid='device.addVirtualDevice' product='2' className='normal' /> button is not visible

Check if the **Event Log API** license is activated.

### When the API call fails

* Check if the **Event Log API** license is activated.

* Check the device ID is a registered virtual device.

* Check if the API parameter format is correct.

### When events are not getting retrieved

* Verify that the recorded device is the correct virtual device ID.

* Check the virtual device is selected in the event filter.

* Check audit trails to ensure no errors occurred when logging events.
