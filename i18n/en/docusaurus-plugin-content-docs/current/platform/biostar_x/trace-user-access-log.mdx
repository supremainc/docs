Tracking and verifying user access history is crucial for enhancing security and improving operational efficiency. You can prevent security threats and optimize operations through access history. You can identify users who attempt to access restricted areas or unauthorized times. This allows for a quick response to security threats. By identifying abnormal signs such as repeated authentication failures or access from unusual time zones, security threats can be detected early.

You can check the user's access history according to the following steps.

1. Click <Cmd sid='shell.header.user' /> on the <Cmd sid='shell.header.launcher' /> page.

2. Click on the user whose access history you want to check from the user list.

3. The selected user's profile information will be displayed on the right side of the screen.
