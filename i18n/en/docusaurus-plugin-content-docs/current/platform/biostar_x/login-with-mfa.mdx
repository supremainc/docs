You can use the **Multi-Factor Authentication** feature to enhance security when logging into **BioStar X**. Enabling <Cmd sid='team.user.permission.multiFactorAuth' /> adds a fingerprint authentication step through a fingerprint scanner to the combination of user ID and password.

:::info

* **Multi-Factor Authentication** refers to the method of authenticating users through two or more authentication procedures.

* Users who want to use the <Cmd sid='team.user.permission.multiFactorAuth' /> feature must enroll their fingerprint and set their username, password, and operator level.

* To use the <Cmd sid='team.user.permission.multiFactorAuth' /> feature, a fingerprint scanner that supports multi-factor authentication login must be connected to the **BioStar X** client PC. Please refer to the list below for devices supported by the fingerprint scanner.

  * BioMini

  * BioMini Plus 2

  * BioMini Slim 2

* If you use the <Cmd>Use for BioStar X Login</Cmd> option with an Active Directory Server account, you will not be able to use the <Cmd sid='team.user.permission.multiFactorAuth' /> feature.

* Users with <Cmd sid='team.user.permission.multiFactorAuth' /> set cannot register for BioStar X services other than BioStar X AC.

:::

:::caution

* After setting up the multi-factor authentication feature for the main admin account (ID 1), please be aware that you will not be able to log in with that account if the fingerprint authentication becomes unavailable.

* If login becomes impossible due to fingerprint issues, please contact [Suprema Technical Support](https://support.supremainc.com).
