You can use the **Multi-Factor Authentication** feature to enhance security when logging into **BioStar X**. Enabling <Cmd sid='team.user.permission.multiFactorAuth' /> adds a fingerprint authentication step through a fingerprint scanner to the combination of user ID and password.

:::info

* Users who want to use the <Cmd sid='team.user.permission.multiFactorAuth' /> feature must enroll their fingerprint and set their username, password, and operator level.

* To use the <Cmd sid='team.user.permission.multiFactorAuth' /> feature, a fingerprint scanner that supports multi-factor authentication login must be connected to the **BioStar X** client PC. Please refer to the list below for devices supported by the fingerprint scanner.

  * BioMini

  * BioMini Plus 2

  * BioMini Slim 2

* If you use the <Cmd sid='settings.activeDirectory.title' product='2' className='normal' /> account with the <Cmd sid='biostar.login' product='2' /> option, you cannot use the <Cmd sid='team.user.permission.multiFactorAuth' /> feature.

* Administrators who set <Cmd sid='team.user.permission.multiFactorAuth' /> cannot authenticate with **BioStar X** services (attendance management and video) other than access control. To use the service, log in after disabling the <Cmd sid='team.user.permission.multiFactorAuth' /> setting. You can then reactivate the <Cmd sid='team.user.permission.multiFactorAuth' /> setting.

:::

:::caution

* After setting up the multi-factor authentication feature for the main admin account (ID 1), be aware that you will not be able to log in with that account if the fingerprint authentication becomes unavailable.

* If login becomes impossible due to fingerprint issues, contact [Suprema Technical Support](https://support.supremainc.com).
