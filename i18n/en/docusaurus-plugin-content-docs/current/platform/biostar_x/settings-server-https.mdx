To connect BioStar X via HTTPS, you must register the IP address where **BioStar X** is installed to install the certificate. 

## When certificate installation is required

If you access **BioStar X** without the HTTPS certificate installed, a security warning like the following will appear in your web browser.

These warnings appear because the browser cannot verify the identity of the server. Installing the certificate will make the browser trust the **BioStar X** server, allowing for a secure HTTPS connection without security warnings.

## Certificate installation

Install the certificate before using **BioStar X** for correct network connectivity.

1. Access the **BioStar X** login page.

2. Click the <Cmd sid='auth.httpsDownload' /> link at the bottom of the screen.

5. Select **BioStar X** for **Target System**, enter the IP address of the PC where **BioStar X** is installed in **Server Address**, and click **Enrollment**.
