* You can also search for devices by entering keywords in the search input field.

* To transfer user information, the device must be connected to the **BioStar X** server.

* If you change information for a user who is already registered on the device, you must resend the user information to reflect the changes on the device. To use the option for synchronizing user information with the device, refer to [the following](settings-server-server#user-sync).

* There is a limit to the number of users that can be registered on each device. Check the number of users that can be registered to the device.
