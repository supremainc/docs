* You can also search for devices by entering keywords in the search input field.

* To transfer user information, the device must be connected to the **BioStar X** server.

* If you change information for a user who is already registered on the device, you must resend the user information to reflect the changes on the device. To use the <Cmd sid='setting.server.automaticUserSync' product='2' /> option for synchronizing user information with the device, refer to [the following](settings-server-server#user-sync).

* There is a limit to the number of users that can be registered on each device. Check the number of users that can be registered to the device.
