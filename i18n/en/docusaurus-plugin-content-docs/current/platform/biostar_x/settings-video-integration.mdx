The **Video Management System** (VMS) is a video management system that integrates and manages video from multiple cameras, allowing for recording and playback. Integrating BioStar X with VMS allows you to manage access control and video security on a single platform.

You can gain the following benefits through VMS integration.

* **Real-time monitoring**: You can view real-time video from cameras connected to doors.

* **Integrated event management**: You can understand security situations by linking access events with video.

* **Efficient evidence collection**: You can quickly search and replay recorded video from specific points in time.

* **Bookmark function**: You can add video tags to important event moments for easy retrieval and review.

## Before start

To integrate with the **Video Management System** (VMS), please check the following items.

* The VMS integration feature is available through additional options for licenses above **Advanced**. For more information on licensing policy, refer to [the following](licensing#features-add-ons).

* Make sure that the VMS server is correctly installed and configured. The VMS server must be in a state that can connect online with **BioStar X**.

* Use a VMS that is compatible with **BioStar X**. You can use **BioStar X VMS** or the **Nx Witness v5.1.5** series of VMS.

* Prepare the IP address, port number, and administrator account information of the VMS server. This information is needed to connect the VMS server with **BioStar X**.

## VMS server integration settings

Follow the steps below to integrate the VMS server with **BioStar X**.

<Steps>
<Step>

### Install the certificate on the VMS server {#install-vms-certification}

To play back recorded video from the VMS server, you must use HTTPS protocol. Generate an IP address-based certificate on the VMS server.

:::note

* Before installing the certificate, ensure that Open JDK 21 or higher is installed on the PC where VMS is installed.

* When installing the VMS server and **BioStar X** on the same server, you will need to install a certificate.

:::

1. Navigate to the *C:\Program Files\BioStar X\third* path and run the command prompt.

2. Execute the following command. 

   <Tabs groupId='os' defaultValue='Windows'>
   <TabItem value="Windows">
   ```java
   java -jar scaleUtil-1.0-all.jar vmsCertCreate "C:\Windows\System32\config\systemprofile\AppData\Local\<%VENDOR.NAME%>\<%VENDOR.NAME%> Media Server\ssl" {VMS_IP_ADDRESS}
   ```
   </TabItem>
   <TabItem value="Linux">
   ```java
   java -jar scaleUtil-1.0-all.jar vmsCertCreate "/opt/<%VENDOR.NAME%>/mediaserver/var/ssl" {VMS_IP_ADDRESS}
   ```
   </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

   * Enter the path where VMS is installed in the `<%VENDOR.NAME%>` section.

   * Enter the IP address of the VMS server in the `{VMS_IP_ADDRESS}` section.

   * The *ssl* path may vary depending on the installed VMS product.

3. Check whether the certificate file (*.pem*) was created in the path where VMS is installed.

4. Reboot the VMS server.

:::info

If VMS is installed on a different server than **BioStar X**, copy the *scaleUtil-1.0-all.jar* file to the VMS server and follow the previous steps.

### Activate VMS integration

1. Click <Cmd sid='shell.header.setting' /> on the <Cmd sid='shell.header.launcher' /> page.

2. On the left sidebar, click <Cmd sid='setting.menu.video.root' /> → <Cmd sid='setting.menu.video.vmsIntegration' />.

3. If this is your first time accessing, log in with the **BioStar X** administrator account.

   <Image src='/img/biostarx-settings-video-integration-login.png' />

4. Set the <Cmd sid='video.setting.integration.title' product='2' /> option to <Cmd sid='common.use' product='2' />.

   <Image src='/img/biostarx-settings-video-integration.png' />

5. Enter the VMS server information.

   * <Cmd sid='video.setting.integration.serverAddress' product='2' />: Enter the IP address of the VMS server.

   * <Cmd sid='video.setting.integration.port' product='2' />: Enter the port number of the VMS server.

   * <Cmd sid='video.setting.integration.loginId' product='2' />: Enter the administrator account ID of the VMS server.

   * <Cmd sid='video.setting.integration.password' product='2' />: Enter the administrator account password of the VMS server.

6. Once you have entered all the VMS server information, click the <Cmd sid='button.apply' product='2' /> button at the bottom right of the screen.

:::info

* If the integration with the VMS server fails and an error message appears, check the server address and administrator account information again. It is also necessary to check whether the VMS server is online and if network connections are blocked due to firewall settings.

* For more information on the settings in the <Cmd sid='video.setting.tag.title' product='2' /> section, refer to [the following](#vms-event-bookmark).

### Restart service

The first time you integrate with the VMS server, **BioStar X** will automatically restart the service. If it does not automatically restart, follow the instructions below to manually restart the service.

1. Click <Start/> → **BioStar X** → **BioStar X Service Manager** on Windows.

2. In the **All Services** list, click the **Stop** button for the services below to stop them.

### Troubleshooting {#video-troubleshooting}

If the following situations occur, you can install the certificate from the VMS server onto the client PC to resolve the issue.

* When accessing **Video Management System** (VMS) through the browser, and a 'Not secure' warning appears

* When real-time video plays on the <Cmd sid='shell.header.arena' /> page but recorded video does not play

#### Certificate installation on client PC {#install-client-certification}

1. Download the HTTPS certificate installer (*cert-register.zip*) from the login screen or <Cmd sid='shell.header.setting' /> → <Cmd sid='setting.menu.server.root' /> → <Cmd sid="setting.https.https" product='2' /> on the client PC where **BioStar X** is installed.

2. Unzip the downloaded file and run **cert-register.exe** file. **Enrollment Certification** window will appears.

3. Select **VMS** for **Target System** and enter the following information.
