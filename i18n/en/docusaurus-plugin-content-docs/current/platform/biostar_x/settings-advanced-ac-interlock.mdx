Interlock is an access control method used in areas where security is important. When interlock is set up in a location with two or more doors, it operates as follows.

* Monitor the status of each door in real-time via door sensors and relays.

* If one door is open or unlocked, all other doors automatically enter a locked state.

* You can set it to block additional access while a user is present at the location.

This method enhances security by preventing multiple doors from being opened simultaneously.

:::info

* A single interlock setting can consist of up to 4 doors.

* Only doors composed of devices connected to CoreStation can have interlock set up.

* Devices set as interlock cannot be used in other interlock settings.

* Doors set as interlock cannot be used in other settings, except fire alarm settings.
