Interlock zone is an access control method used in areas where security is essential. This zone has two or more doors and operates as follows:

* Monitor the status of each door in real-time via door sensors and relays.

* If one door is open or unlocked, all other doors automatically enter a locked state.

* It can be set to block additional access while a user remains within the zone.

This method enhances security by preventing multiple doors from being opened simultaneously.

:::info

* A single interlock zone can consist of up to 4 doors.

* Only doors configured with devices connected to CoreStation can be set as an interlock zone.

* Devices set as an interlock zone cannot be configured to another zone.

* Doors set as an interlock zone cannot be configured to any zone other than the fire alarm zone.
