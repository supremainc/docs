Step-by-step settings are provided to ensure the proper operation of **BioStar X** after initial installation. Follow each step sequentially to build an efficient access control environment.

<Steps>
<Step>

## Device enrollment

Register a device to connect to **BioStar X**. Configure separate authentication modes based on the devices or assign administrators to each device.

Additionally, set actions based on various events generated by the device (such as authentication failure, duress fingerprint authentication, anti-passback violations, etc.).

</Step>
<Step>

## Door enrollment and settings

Register the door information where the devices are installed. Configure relay, anti-passback, dual authentication, alarms, and more.

* <DocLink docId='platform/biostar_x/settings-door-add' />

</Step>
<Step>

## Access level settings

Access levels are created by combining door and schedule information, allowing multiple doors and schedules to be registered under a single access level.

</Step>
<Step>

## Access group settings

Access groups are created by combining access levels (doors, schedules) and user information, enabling multiple access levels and users to be registered under a single access group.

<DocLink docId='platform/biostar_x/settings-access-control-manage-access-group' />

</Step>
<Step>

## User enrollment

Register user information, including fingerprints and other data used for access control. User information can be directly registered on the device or on the server where **BioStar X** operates. In addition, user information registered on the device can be imported to **BioStar X**, or user information registered in **BioStar X** can be sent to the device.

* <DocLink docId='platform/biostar_x/add-user' />

* <DocLink docId='platform/biostar_x/enroll-credential' />

</Step>
<Step>

## Advanced access control settings

Configure anti-passback and fire alarm zones, allowing settings for local and global zones within the fire alarm area.
