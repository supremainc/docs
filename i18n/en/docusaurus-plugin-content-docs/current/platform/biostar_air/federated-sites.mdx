BioStar Air provides **federated sites**, enabling a primary site to seamlessly manage multiple subsites. This feature is ideal for multi-tenant buildings or organizations with multiple branches and offers centralized control through distributed access management.

By leveraging the federated site feature in BioStar Air, administrators effectively manage access in complex environments and deliver a secure, scalable, and streamlined experience for all stakeholders.

## What is a federated site? {#whatFederatedSites}

**Federated sites** support a hierarchical structure in which a **primary site** manages one or more **subsites**. An administrator of the primary site—called the **federation administrator**—can directly access and manage subsites from the BioStar Air interface.

Federated sites are useful in the following situations.

### Multi-tenant building

For example, in a commercial building where each floor is occupied by a different company, configure the system as follows.

* **Master account** for the building

* **Subaccount** for each tenant company

This setup authorizes only employees with access to a specific floor, simplifying building management.

### Multi-branch organization

A company with offices in multiple locations can configure the system as follows.

* Manage global settings through a **master account**

* Create a **subaccount** for each branch

For example, a company with ten offices worldwide can use a federated structure to streamline management.

## Set up federated sites {#setFederatedSites}

<Step>

### Access Partner Portal

URL: [https://partner.biostarair.com](https://partner.biostarair.com)

* Only partners and installers can use the BioStar Air Partner Portal.

* End customers must contact an installer to configure this feature.

</Step>
<Step>

### Create primary site

1. Log in to the [Partner Portal](https://partner.biostarair.com).

2. Click **Create Site**, and in **Site Profile** select **Federated Site**.

   * This step **must** be performed when first setting up the site.

   * A standard site cannot be converted to a federated site later.

3. Add a federation site administrator on the same screen.

   * A **federation site administrator** added in the Partner Portal can access the primary site and all subsites.

   * A **general administrator** added in BioStar Air can manage only individual sites.

</Step>
<Step>

### Add subsites

1. After the primary site is set as a federated site, the **Site List** shows an option to create subsites.

2. Click **Create Subsite** and configure it like any other site.

## Important considerations {#important-considerations}

### User and device management {#user-and-reader-management}

* Add users and devices separately to each subsite.

* A device can be registered to only one site at a time. Select either the primary site or a subsite.

### Primary site usage {#primary-site-usage}

* Certain customers use the primary site only as an access point for subsite management and do not register any users or devices in the primary site.

* **Example 1**: A company with three branch offices sets up a primary site with no devices and creates a subsite for each branch.

* **Example 2**: A company with headquarters and three branches registers users and devices at headquarters (the primary site) and sets up subsites for the branches.

### Billing {#billing}

* Billing is calculated based on the number of registered devices (readers) per site.

* There is no additional cost to create a primary site without registered devices.
