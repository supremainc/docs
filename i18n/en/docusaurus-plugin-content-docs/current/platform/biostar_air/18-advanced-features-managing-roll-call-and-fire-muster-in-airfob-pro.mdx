## Feature Overview {#feature-overview}

The Roll Call & Fire Muster feature in BioStar Air allows organizations to track which employees have safely exited a building during an emergency. By setting up muster points and using the BioStar Air app, administrators can quickly account for all users and generate roll call history reports.

## Setting Up Muster Points {#setting-up-muster-points}

A muster point is a designated area where users can tap their credentials to mark themselves as safe during an emergency.

1. Go to **Advanced** → **Roll Call** in the BioStar Air portal.

1. Click **Add Muster Point**.

1. Enter a **Name** (e.g., "East Parking Lot").

1. Enter an optional **Description** (e.g., "Third pillar in the parking structure").

1. Add devices:

   * Click **Add Device** to assign a specific reader.

   * Alternatively, select a **Device Group** to include multiple muster point readers.

1. Add user groups:

   * Select **User Groups** that should report to this muster point.

   * Click **Add** after each selection.

1. Click **Save** to finalize the muster point setup.

### Best Practices for Muster Points {#best-practices}

* Use **device groups** instead of individual devices to allow multiple muster points.

* Ensure that **only relevant users** are assigned to specific muster points, especially in large campuses with multiple buildings.

* Wired access control readers support both **mobile and card authentication**, while Airfob Tag and Airfob Patch require mobile credentials.


## Starting a Roll Call in the BioStar Air App {#starting-a-roll-call-in-the-biostar-air-app}

To initiate a roll call using the BioStar Air mobile app:

1. Open the BioStar Air app.

1. Go to **All Menu** → **Roll Call** (under Advanced Features).

1. Press **Roll Call Start**.

1. The system will display a list of all users currently on-site.

### Marking Users Safe {#marking-users-safe}

Users can mark themselves safe by:

* Tapping their credential at an assigned muster point.

* Administrators manually marking users safe by pressing and holding the **Checkmark** button next to their name.

### Tracking Roll Call Progress {#tracking-roll-call-progress}

* Users can be filtered by their **Muster Group**.

* The search function allows finding specific individuals.

* The roll call is complete when:

  * All users are marked safe.

  * An administrator manually marks all users as safe.

  * 24 hours pass without completion.


## Viewing Roll Call History {#viewing-roll-call-history}

To check past roll calls:

1. Go to **Roll Call** in the BioStar Air portal.

1. Click the **History** tab.

1. Select a completed roll call to view:

   * A list of all logged access events during the roll call.

   * Details on whether users were marked safe or unaccounted for.

   * Time of roll call initiation and completion.


## Key Considerations {#key-considerations}

* **Ensure muster points are properly assigned** to user groups to prevent confusion.

* **Test the Roll Call feature** regularly to ensure smooth operation in case of an actual emergency.

* **Access logs** can be used to verify attendance for compliance with safety regulations.
