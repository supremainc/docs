## Feature Overview {#feature-overview}

Door groups and device groups in BioStar Air provide a structured way to organize site devices and access points. Grouping devices and doors simplifies access level configuration and system management.

<CustomerNote />


## Navigating to Device Groups {#navigating-to-device-groups}

To manage device groups:

1. Go to **Device Management** in the BioStar Air Portal.

1. Click on **Device Groups** to view the existing groups.

## Creating a Device Group {#creating-a-device-group}

To create a new device group:

1. Click on **Add Device Group**.

1. Enter a group name (e.g., "Patches").

1. Select the devices to be included in this group.

1. Click **OK** to save.


## Creating a Subgroup {#creating-a-subgroup}

Device groups can have subgroups for further organization. However, groups are **not hierarchical**, meaning devices in a subgroup are not automatically included in the parent group.

1. Click **Subgroup** under Device Groups.

1. Select a parent group (e.g., "Readers").

1. Enter a subgroup name (e.g., "BioStar Air Readers").

1. Select the devices to be included.

1. Click **OK** to save.


## Assigning Devices to Multiple Groups {#assigning-devices-to-multiple-groups}

Devices can belong to more than one group. To add devices to additional groups:

1. Go to **Registered Devices**.

1. Select the devices you want to assign.

1. Click **Manage Groups**.

1. Choose additional groups and confirm.

Assigned groups will be displayed in the device list.


## Navigating to Door Groups {#navigating-to-door-groups}

To manage door groups:

1. Go to **Door Management** in the BioStar Air Portal.

1. Click on **Door Groups** to view the existing groups.


## Creating a Door Group {#creating-a-door-group}

To create a new door group:

1. Click **Add Door Group**.

1. Enter a group name (e.g., "Interior Doors").

1. Select the doors to be included.

1. Click **OK** to save.


## Creating a Door Group Subgroup {#creating-a-door-group-subgroup}

Door groups can have subgroups, but like device groups, they are **not hierarchical**. Adding a door to a subgroup does not automatically include it in the parent group.

1. Click **Add Subgroup** under Door Groups.

1. Select a parent group (e.g., "Interior Doors").

1. Enter a subgroup name (e.g., "Trap Doors").

1. Select the doors to be included.

1. Click **OK** to save.


## Key Considerations {#key-considerations}

### Device & Door Group Hierarchy {#device-and-door-group-hierarchy}

* Adding a door or device to a subgroup does not automatically add it to the parent group.

* If assigning groups to access levels, ensure that you add the **specific subgroup** needed rather than just the parent group.

### Group Organization {#group-organization}

* It is possible to create empty parent groups without any devices or doors.

* Filtering options allow viewing devices and doors by group.


## Can one device belong to multiple device groups?

**Yes**. In BioStar Air, a single device can be assigned to **multiple device groups** without limitation.

This differs from BioStar 2, where device grouping was more rigid. In BioStar Air, flexible grouping enables better filtering, monitoring, and access control configurations:

* Use logical groupings like "Exterior Devices" or "Biometric Readers" to organize devices by location or type.

* Device groups can be used to **filter Event Logs**, **create Reports**, or **filter the Devices screen** for easier troubleshooting or reporting.

* For **muster point** configuration, devices (not doors) are assigned. Using device groups helps ensure users are marked safe **only** when they use designated exit readers.
