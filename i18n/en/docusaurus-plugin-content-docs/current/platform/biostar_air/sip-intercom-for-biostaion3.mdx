# SIP Intercom Configuration

Starting from **BioStar Air v2.10**, SIP intercom functionality is supported on the **BioStation 3** (BS3). This enables two-way audio calls between the reader and administrators, as well as remote door unlocking.

This feature requires a SIP server, which must be purchased and configured separately. Suprema does not provide SIP service.

## About SIP

The **Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)** is a communication protocol widely used for initiating, maintaining, and terminating real-time voice and video calls over IP networks. In this case, SIP enables the BioStation 3 to act as an intercom endpoint, making and receiving calls through a compatible SIP service.


## Receiving Calls

Incoming calls from the BioStation 3 can be received via:

* **BioStar Air Web**: Receive calls directly in your web browser.

* **BioStar Air Mobile App** (iOS / Android): Receive calls on the go.


## Remote Door Control

When answering a SIP call, doors can be opened using **DTMF commands** from:

* A physical SIP phone

* The BioStar Air Mobile App

* The BioStar Air Web interface


## Configuration Steps

Configuration is required in two places: device settings and administrator account settings.
