# Configure SIP intercom

As of **BioStar Air v2.10**, **BioStation 3** (BS3) supports the SIP intercom feature. This enables two-way voice calls between the reader and administrators and remote door unlocking.

A SIP server is required to use this feature; purchase and configure it separately. Suprema does not provide SIP services.
