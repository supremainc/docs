# BioStar Air Login - Using the Site Selector

## Overview {#overview}

Managing multiple sites on BioStar Air portal used to require a separate email address and password for each site, making the process cumbersome and time-consuming. With the new **Site Selector** feature, you can now use a single email address to manage multiple sites, simplifying the process and reducing the need for multiple logins.

## What is the Site Selector? {#what-is-the-site-selector}

The **Site Selector** feature allows you to log in to the BioStar Air portal using one consolidated email address, even if you’re managing multiple sites. This eliminates the need for different login credentials for each site. Once logged in, you can easily switch between the sites you’re an admin for via the Site Selector menu.

### For New Sites {#for-new-sites}

When creating a new site through the Partner Portal, you can now use an existing email address that you’ve already registered as an admin for another site. The system will automatically link the new site to your existing email, allowing you to manage multiple sites under one account.

**Steps for New Sites**:

* Create a new site through the Partner Portal as you normally would.

* When prompted for an admin email, use an email address that is already associated with another site.

* The new site will automatically be linked to your existing account.

### For Existing Sites {#for-existing-sites}

If you already manage multiple sites but have separate login credentials for each, you will need to request a manual migration from **Suprema**. This process consolidates your email addresses so that you can manage all sites under a single login.

**Steps for Existing Sites**:

* Contact MOCA support and request a manual migration for your sites.

* If you are using alias addresses like bob+site1@example.com and bob+site2@example.com, provide the root email address (bob@example.com).

* If you are using completely unique addresses for each site, provide a full list of those addresses.

* Once the migration is complete, you will be able to access all your sites with a single email address via the Site Selector.


## How to Log In and Use the Site Selector {#how-to-log-in-and-use-the-site-selector}

Once you have a consolidated email address, logging in and switching between sites becomes straightforward:

**Steps to Log In**:

1. **Log in**: Enter your consolidated email address and password as usual.

2. **Select the Site**: Upon logging in, the Site Selector menu will automatically appear, displaying a list of all sites associated with your email address.

3. **Search and Navigate**: If you manage many sites, use the search bar to quickly find the one you’re looking for. Select the site, and you’ll be directed to its dashboard.


## Additional Notes {#additional-notes}

* **Security**: Even though you are using a consolidated email, each site’s permissions and settings remain independent. Admin roles and access rights are unique to each site.

* **Troubleshooting**: If you don’t see the Site Selector or if the wrong sites appear, ensure that your migration request has been completed or contact MOCA support for further assistance.

By simplifying the login process and consolidating your sites under one account, the Site Selector feature saves time and effort while managing multiple sites on BioStar Air.
