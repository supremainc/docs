## Overview {#overview}

The **SIO2 Secure Module** enhances security in your access control system by acting as an intermediary between the Suprema or Airfob reader and the relay. It communicates with the reader via an **RS485 cable**, with encrypted communication to prevent security breaches.

:::caution

**Please refer to the wiring diagrams included in the box with your SIO2 Secure Module for accurate setup instructions.** Since installation may vary depending on the environment, professional assistance from your local Suprema installer may be required.
