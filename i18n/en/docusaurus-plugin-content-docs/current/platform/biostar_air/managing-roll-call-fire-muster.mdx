:::note

**Best practices for muster zones**

* Make the muster zone name and description clear and easy to understand. For example, use names like 'East Parking Lot' or 'Main Building Lobby'.

* When adding multiple devices to a muster zone, select a device group instead of individual devices. Device groups let you manage multiple devices at once. For more information on device group management, refer to [the following](manage-device-group).

* In a large campus with multiple buildings, assign **only relevant users** to a specific muster zone.

* Wired access control devices support both mobile and card authentication, whereas Airfob Tag and Airfob Patch support only mobile credentials.
