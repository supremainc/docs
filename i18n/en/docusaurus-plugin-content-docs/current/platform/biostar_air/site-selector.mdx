Managing multiple sites in the BioStar Air portal used to require a separate email address and password for each site. This made the process cumbersome and time-consuming. The new **Site Selector** feature simplifies processes and reduces the need to log in multiple times by allowing management of multiple sites with a single email address.

## What is Site Selector? {#siteSelector}

The Site Selector feature enables signing in to the BioStar Air portal with a single, unified email address even when managing multiple sites. There is no need to sign in with different email addresses for each site. Sign in once with a single email address, and then use the Site Selector menu to switch easily between the sites being managed.

## Create a new site {#newSite}

When creating a new site through the Partner Portal, use an email address that is already registered as an administrator account for another site. The system automatically links the new site to the existing email, allowing management of multiple sites with a single account.

* Create a new site via the [Partner Portal](https://partner.biostarair.com/).

* When prompted for the administrator email, enter the email address that is already linked to another site.

* The new site is automatically linked to the existing account.

## Use with existing sites {#existingSites}

If multiple sites are already managed but each uses separate sign-in credentials, request a manual migration from Suprema. This process consolidates the email addresses, enabling management of all sites with a single sign-in.

* Contact the MOCA support team and request a manual migration for the sites.

* If alias addresses such as bob+site1@example.com and bob+site2@example.com are used, provide the root email address (bob@example.com).

* If completely unique email addresses are used for each site, provide the full list of email addresses.

* Once migration is complete, access all sites with a single email address through the Site Selector feature.

## Use Site Selector {#howToLogInAndUseTheSiteSelector}

With a unified email address, logging in and switching between sites is straightforward.

1. **Log in**: Enter the unified email address and password.

2. **Site Selector**: After signing in, the Site Selector feature automatically appears and lists all sites linked to the email address.

3. **Search and navigate**: When managing many sites, use the search bar to quickly find the desired site. Selecting a site takes you to the dashboard.

* **Security**: Even when a unified email is used, each site's permissions and settings remain independent. Administrator roles and access rights are managed separately for each site.

* **Troubleshooting**: If the Site Selector feature does not appear or an incorrect site is shown, verify that the migration request is complete or contact the MOCA support team for further assistance.

By streamlining the sign-in process and consolidating multiple sites under one account, the Site Selector feature saves time and effort when managing several sites in BioStar Air.
