## Step 1: Wire {#wiring}

Connect the E200-series QR scanner using the included adapter cable as shown below.

* The green terminal block has pins labeled **1 through 4**, arranged **right-to-left** when you face the front of the connector.

   | Pin | Wire color | Feature |
   | :-: | --- | --- |
   | 1 | Black | Negative / Ground |
   | 2 | Red | Positive (V+) |
   | 3 | Yellow (white stripe) | RS-485 TRXN |
   | 4 | Blue (white stripe) | RS-485 TRXP |

   :::info

   The wiring direction is the exact opposite of many other connectors. Check the orientation again before wiring.

   :::

* Attach the 4-pin connector to the CON port on the bottom of the QR scanner. Because the connector is **polarized** (keyed), it fits only one way.

## Step 2: Enable the QR reader {#enable-qr-reader}

1. Sign in to the [BioStar Air portal](https://admin.biostarair.com) (web or app).

2. Click <Cmd sid="device_menu" product="air" /> → <Cmd sid="device_submenu" product="air" /> in the left sidebar.

3. Click the device that has the connected E200 QR scanner.

4. Enable the <Cmd sid="device_editable_fields_qr_reader" product="air" /> option in the <Cmd sid="device_edit_device_info" product="air" /> section.

5. Click <Cmd sid="save_btn" product="air" /> to save the changes.

:::info

Enabling the QR reader prevents you from using other RS-485 devices (for example, an SIO2) on the same reader.

## Step 3: Configure the QR scanner {#configure-qr-scanner}

By default, the **E200 QR scanner** is set to a baud rate of **115,200**. Change the baud rate to **9,600** to use it with Suprema devices.

Connect the QR scanner to the device and **scan the barcode below** to apply the new baud rate.

When the wiring is correct and the Suprema device is connected to the network, use the **dynamic QR credentials** provided through BioStar Air.
