With door schedules in BioStar Air, administrators can automate door locking and unlocking based on time settings. Schedule settings help ensure safe, controlled access. Administrators can set lock and unlock schedules and configure advanced options such as <Cmd sid="unlock_after_first_auth" product="air" />.

:::info

* Schedules apply only to doors and devices that are **connected to the internet**.

* Holiday groups ignore unlock schedules unless they are configured separately.

* Keep at least one administrator with unrestricted access for emergencies.

5. Click <Cmd sid="btn_ok" product="air" /> to apply the unlock schedule.

* When <Cmd sid="unlock_after_first_auth" product="air" /> is enabled, the door stays unlocked according to the selected schedule after the first user authenticates. This option is useful for offices and retail stores where the door must remain locked until the first employee arrives.
