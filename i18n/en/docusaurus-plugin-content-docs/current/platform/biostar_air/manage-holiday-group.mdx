In BioStar Air, a holiday group is used to adjust access rules for specific dates or periods. By configuring a holiday group, administrators can restrict or change access permissions on public holidays or special days. This approach maintains security while providing flexible access control.

import CustomerNote from '../../common/_biostarair-customer-notice.mdx';

<CustomerNote />

## Add a holiday group

A holiday group defines holidays that recur annually and holidays within specific periods, and is used to restrict or change access permissions during those periods.

import AddHolidayGroup from '../../common/_add-holiday-group.mdx';

<AddHolidayGroup />

:::info

* Holiday groups take precedence over schedules. Grant unrestricted access to users who always need entry.

* Manage fixed-date holidays (e.g., New Year's Day, Children's Day) and movable holidays (e.g., Chuseok, Lunar New Year) in separate groups.
