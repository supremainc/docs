BioStar Air lets you efficiently manage multiple devices by grouping them. Device groups allow you to apply the same setting to multiple devices at once or easily monitor the status of devices in a certain group.

## Add a device group

1. Click <Cmd sid="device_menu" product="air" /> → <Cmd sid="device_groups_submenu" product="air" /> in the left sidebar.
