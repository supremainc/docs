### Bluetooth {#bluetooth}

Choose between two Bluetooth authentication modes.

* <Cmd>Only while App is on Screen</Cmd>: Authenticate with a mobile card only when the app is open on the mobile device. This mode saves battery but requires manually launching the app before approaching the door.

* <Cmd>Background Mode</Cmd>: Authenticate with a mobile card even if the device screen is off when the app runs in the background. This mode is more convenient but consumes more battery. If the app closes, relaunch it to resume background functions.

### NFC {#nfc}

NFC authentication is available only on Android devices. Use NFC alone or with Bluetooth for faster entry.

:::info

Android users with an NFC-compatible device can use NFC with Bluetooth.

:::

## Two-factor authentication (2FA) {#twoFactorAuth}

Enable two-factor authentication with a **PIN, pattern, or biometric authentication** (face or fingerprint) for additional security.

:::info

* This feature is not supported in <Cmd>Background Mode</Cmd> connections because the app screen must remain open during access authentication.

* If the PIN or pattern is forgotten, reinstall the app and reactivate the mobile card.

* Supported features may vary depending on the mobile device.
