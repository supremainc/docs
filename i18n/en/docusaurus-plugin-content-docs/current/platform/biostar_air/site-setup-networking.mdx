BioStar Air must access specific network ports to operate properly. Network ports allow secure communication between compatible readers, cloud services, and user applications. Administrators may need to verify a BioStar Air-compatible reader's MAC address from its serial number for network configuration tasks.

## Required network ports

Verify that the following ports are open on the network firewall.

* **6379**, **6381**: Redis Ports

   Used to synchronize user information, handle fast event logging, manage sessions, and serve as a message broker for signaling between devices and the cloud.

* **5671**: AMQP over TLS (RabbitMQ)

   Provides a secure messaging protocol for real-time communication between services.

* **443**: HTTPS (TLS)

   Used for standard secure web traffic and required for the following services:

   * Access to the management portal web app through a web browser

   * BioStar Air mobile app (iOS/Android)

   * API calls

   * Device firmware updates through the cloud

   * Device login and authentication services

* When using BioStar Air's built-in video management feature:

   * Web-socket domain: eu-wss-api.airfob.com

   * Web-socket Port: 3500

   * TURN/STUN Ports: 80, 443, 3478, 5349

:::info

Verify access to the following endpoints for device login and authentication.

* [https://e-afs-api.airfob.com/v1/device/login](https://e-afs-api.airfob.com/v1/device/login) (Europe)

* [https://afs-api.airfob.com/v1/device/login](https://afs-api.airfob.com/v1/device/login) (Rest of world)

## Check the MAC address from the serial number

In certain cases, administrators need to determine a BioStar Air-compatible reader's MAC address using only its serial number. This is useful for tasks such as adding the device to a whitelist before adding it to the network.

### Steps

1. **Find the serial number**:

   Locate the 9-digit serial number on the back of the device.

2. **Convert the serial number to hexadecimal**:

   Use a calculator or an online tool to convert the serial number from decimal to hexadecimal.

3. **Extract the last 3 bytes**:

   Take the last six characters from the hexadecimal value. These six characters represent the last 3 bytes.

4. **Build the MAC address**:

   The MAC address always starts with `00:17:FC:`. Append the last 3 bytes (six characters) from the hexadecimal value, separating each pair with a colon.

### Example

1. **Serial number**: 546089489

2. **Hexadecimal**: 208CAA11

3. **Last 3 bytes**: 8CAA11

4. **MAC address**: 00:17:FC:8C:AA:11

These steps allow accurate identification of a BioStar Air-compatible reader on the network using its serial number.
