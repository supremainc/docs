The BioStar Air Partner Portal is an exclusive tool for value-added resellers (VARs) that lets them manage customer sites, distribute credits, and efficiently oversee administrative functions.

:::info

* The Partner Portal is for value-added resellers (VARs) only and not for site administrators or end customers.

* If you do not receive an invitation email, check your spam folder or contact your Partner Portal administrator.

* Verify that the email used for registration is correct. This cannot be changed later.

### Understand roles and permissions {#understanding-roles-and-permissions}

The partner portal has four permission levels.

* <Cmd sid="observer_role" product="air" className="bold" />: Can view site information but cannot make changes.

* <Cmd sid="operator_role" product="air" className="bold" />: Can set up new sites and allocate credits but cannot modify administrator permissions or invite new administrators.

* <Cmd sid="admin_role" product="air" className="bold" />: Can invite and manage other administrators but cannot remove master level users.

* <Cmd sid="master_role" product="air" className="bold" />: Has full control of the portal, including user management, site creation, and credit allocation. Only master level users can activate the Partner Portal account initially.

:::info

Set up and activate a master account before users with other permission levels can access the portal.
