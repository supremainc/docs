### Understanding Ami Roles and Permissions {#understanding-ami-roles-and-permissions}

The Partner Portal has four levels of permissions:

* **Observer**: Can view site information but cannot make any changes.

* **Operator**: Can set up new sites and assign credits but cannot modify administrator privileges or invite new administrators.

* **Administrator**: Can invite and manage other administrators but cannot remove Master-level users.

* **Master**: Has full control over the portal, including user management, site creation, and credit distribution. Only a Master can activate a Partner Portal account initially.

:::note

A Master account must be set up and activated before other users (Administrators, Operators, or Observers) can access the portal.

## Common Issues & Considerations {#common-issues-considerations}

* The Partner Portal is for VARs only and not for site administrators or end users.

* If you do not receive the email invitation, check your spam folder or contact your Partner Portal administrator.

* Ensure the email used for registration is correct, as it cannot be changed later.
