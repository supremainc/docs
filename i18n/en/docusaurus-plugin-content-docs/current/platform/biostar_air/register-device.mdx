:::info

* Devices cannot be registered on the web portal. Register the device via the BioStar Air mobile app.

* When registering a device, keep the device close to the mobile device and ensure that Bluetooth is enabled on the mobile device.

* Disable the <Cmd en="Create a door with this device">Create a door with this device</Cmd> option in the device registration window to avoid setting the registered device as a door.
