To add multiple users in bulk:

1. Go to **User Management** in the BioStar Air Portal.

1. Click on **Users** to open the user list interface.

1. Click on the **Download CSV Template** button.


## Preparing the CSV File {#preparing-the-csv-file}

After downloading the CSV template, fill in the required details for each user. Key fields include:

* **User Group ID**: Retrieve this from the **User Group** screen in BioStar Air Portal.

* **Access Level ID**: Retrieve this from the **Access Levels** screen. *Full access* is always set as **1**.

* **Email Address**: Required if issuing invitations via email (must be unique).

* **Mobile Phone Number**: Required if issuing invitations via mobile (must be unique).


## Uploading the CSV File {#uploading-the-csv-file}

Once the CSV file is ready:

1. Drag and drop the file into the **Upload CSV** window.

1. Review the column data in the preview window to ensure accuracy.

1. Proceed with the upload if the data is correct.


## Uploading User Profile Images {#uploading-user-profile-images}

Profile images can be uploaded automatically along with the CSV file. Follow these guidelines:

1. Ensure that each image file name matches the user ID in the CSV file (e.g., *601.jpg* corresponds to user ID **601**).

1. Select all images and drag them into the **Bulk User Images** upload area.

1. If images are not ready at the time of CSV upload, they can be added later using the **Image Upload** button.
