## Overview {#overview}

Airfob Pro can automatically detect IP cameras that are connected to the same network as an Airfob Edge Reader. The cameras use the reader as a gateway, eliminating the need for an NVR (Network Video Recorder). Instead, the cameras utilize the built-in SD card storage.

For each Airfob Edge Reader or XPass 2 installed, BioStar Air can show simultaneous live view streams for:

* Up to 2 cameras at Full HD resolution (1080p)

* Up to 4 cameras at HD resolution (720p)

These numbers double when using the XStation 2


## Compatibility {#compatibility}

* **Onvif Profiles**: IP cameras must be compatible with Onvif profiles S and/or G.

  * **Onvif Profile S**: Streaming Live Video

  * **Onvif Profile G**: Record Video to an SD Card

* **SD Card**: IP cameras should have an on-board SD card to record video for later playback. (We recommend SanDisk microSDXC Class10 Max Endurance 256GB or 512GB)

* **Encoding**: Cameras must support H.264 (AVC) and it must be enabled as the active CODEC. Airfob Space does not currently support H.265.

* **Recommended Brands**: We have excellent compatibility with Hanwha, Hikvision, and Dahua cameras. Compatibility with other brands may vary depending on their adherence to Onvif profiles.

* **Testing New Cameras**: If you have other camera brands that you would like to test, our team can assist you through the process.


## Functionality {#functionality}

In the Airfob Pro app, you can:

* View live camera feeds.

* View recorded camera feeds.

* Access camera footage associated with access events.
