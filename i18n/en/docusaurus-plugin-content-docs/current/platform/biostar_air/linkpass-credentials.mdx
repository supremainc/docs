LinkPass is a mobile credential that can be used in BioStar Air without an app. Administrators can grant users access without installing an app or using BLE or NFC. Because LinkPass operates through the BioStar Air cloud and is activated via a secure web link, it is ideal for customer entry, deliveries, or low-security entrances such as parking gates and lobbies.

## Step-by-step guide {#stepBystepGuide}

## Notes {#reference}

* **Credential scope**: A LinkPass credential grants access to the same doors as the user's other assigned credentials. Therefore, **do not issue a LinkPass credential to users with access to secure areas**.

* **No app required**: LinkPass works through a web browser, so it does not need a mobile app, Bluetooth, or NFC communication.

* **Cloud-based access**: LinkPass commands are sent through the BioStar Air cloud and can be activated from anywhere with an internet connection. It does not share or track location.

* **Reader connectivity**: The door reader must be online and connected to BioStar Air for LinkPass to work properly.

* **Recommended use cases**: LinkPass is suitable for temporary visitors, deliveries, and low-security areas such as lobbies or parking gates.
