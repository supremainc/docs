## Feature Overview {#feature-overview}

BioStar Air supports complete elevator access control using Suprema's OM120 module. This module allows administrators to control floor access by integrating with Suprema or Airfob access control readers. They support up to 144 floors through daisy-chained OM120 devices.

<CustomerNote />

## Requirements {#requirements}

To enable elevator access control, you must have:

* A Suprema **OM120** module (each supports up to 12 floors).

* A compatible Suprema or Airfob access control reader connected to the OM120.

* Proper wiring to the elevator control panel (contact your elevator manufacturer for wiring specifics).

## Setting Up Elevator Control {#setting-up-elevator-control}

To configure elevator control:

1. Go to **Device Management**.

1. Select an **Airfob Edge Reader Ultimate** that has an OM120 module connected.

1. If the OM120 module is not detected, click **Search OM120**.

1. Select the detected OM120 module(s) and click **OK**.

1. Navigate to **Elevator Management** and click **Add Elevator**.

1. Enter an **Elevator Name** and optional description.

1. Select the controlling **Airfob Edge Reader**.

1. Choose the registered OM120 module(s) for the elevator.

1. Set the **Relay Timeout** (determines how long the floor button remains active after authentication).

1. Specify the **Number of Floors** the module controls (up to 12 per OM120).


## Naming and Configuring Floors {#naming-and-configuring-floors}

Once an elevator is added, you can configure individual floors:

1. Assign names to floors (e.g., "Ground Floor," "Lobby," "Conference Level").

1. Select the relay output that corresponds to each floor's button in the elevator control panel.

1. Set a schedule for when each floor is accessible (e.g., restrict maintenance floors outside of work hours).

1. Click **Save** to finalize the elevator setup.


## Setting Floor Access Levels {#setting-floor-access-levels}

Floor access levels define which users or groups can access specific floors.

1. Go to **Access Management** â†’ **Floor Levels**.

1. Click **Add Floor Level**.

1. Enter a **Name** (e.g., "Security," "Cleaning Crew").

1. Assign specific floors to this access level.

1. Apply an **Access Schedule** (e.g., allow cleaning staff access only after hours).

1. Optionally, add **Holiday Groups** to restrict access on specific days.

1. Click **Save** to apply the settings.


## Key Considerations {#key-considerations}

* **Wiring Requirements**: The OM120 module must be correctly wired to the elevator control panel. Contact your elevator manufacturer for wiring specifications.

* **Daisy-Chaining Modules**: Up to 12 OM120 modules can be linked to a single Airfob Edge Reader, supporting a maximum of 144 floors.

* **Schedules & Overrides**: Floor access schedules take priority, but holiday settings can override normal access rules.
