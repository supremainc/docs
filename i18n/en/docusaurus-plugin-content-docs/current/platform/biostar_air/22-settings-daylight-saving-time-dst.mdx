## Common Issues & Considerations {#common-issues-and-considerations}

In **Event Logs**:

* If device time is set, event log timestamps will be coordinated with the DST time for each individual device.

* If site time is set, timestamps will be adjusted according to the site's DST configuration rather than per device.
