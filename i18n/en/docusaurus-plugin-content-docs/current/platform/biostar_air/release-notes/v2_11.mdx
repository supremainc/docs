# BioStar Air 2.11 - Release Highlights

November 25, 2025

BioStar Air 2.11 continues our commitment to making cloud access control more reliable than traditional on-premise systems. This release introduces major improvements to offline behavior, updates to the admin experience, and powerful new capabilities for BioStation 3.

Whether you're managing a single site or dozens of locations, this update makes BioStar Air easier to use, more resilient, and ready for more complex deployments.

## RFID Card Active Sync on XPass 2 and XStation 2

As part of our long-term goal to exceed the reliability of on-premise access control, we’ve fully re-engineered how BioStar Air handles credential redundancy. With the new **Active Sync** architecture, readers continue working normally even when disconnected from the network.

All primary credential types remain fully functional during network outages:

- **RF Cards**

- **Biometric Templates**

- **Mobile Credentials**

- **PINs**

**You'll still need a network connection to use Dynamic QR and LinkPass Credentials**.

Readers still plug in and sync automatically, with no new installation steps. Credential data is continuously synchronized in the background.

This feature is being rolled out by device type:

- **BioStation 3 / BioEntry W3**

   Available now. No firmware update required.

- **XPass 2**

   Rolling out beginning **Nov 25, 2025**.

   If firmware v2.11 is not visible yet, please be patient. All customers will receive it by **Dec 9**.

- **XStation 2**

   Scheduled for release on **Dec 23, 2025**.

## Interface Updates

We've made several UI enhancements to simplify everyday administration and reduce repetitive actions.

### Device List

- Added a **Refresh Status**(<IcAirRef width='24px' height='24px' />) button for situations where the displayed status may be out of date.

- You can now **delete devices directly from the web portal** without using the mobile app. _Note: Devices must have an active network connection or they will still need to be deleted with the mobile app. Supported on the same schedule as firmware updates listed above._

### Personal Information Masking

A new **Mask Personal Information** button hides sensitive user details while viewing event logs, admin logs, or user information on-screen. Helpful for audits or shared-screen reviews.

### Reports

All dropdown filters are now **searchable**, making it easier to build report templates quickly.

### User List

Improved the user-selection UI. Admins now see a **visual count of selected users** before performing batch actions.

### Partner Portal

- Improved **user and device counts**.

- Improved **site deletion workflow** warns you if devices are still registered to the site.

## BioStation 3 – Video Gateway Support

BioStation 3 can now operate as a **video gateway**, allowing it to process and relay video streams from multiple 4K cameras simultaneously. This gives sites a powerful and flexible way to deploy video without additional hardware.

To enable:

1.  Update your BioStation 3 firmware.

1.  Open Device Settings for your BioStation 3.

1.  Toggle **Video Gateway** on.

## Event Logs & Alerts

Previously, some network-disconnection logs were stored on the device and only uploaded once the reader reconnected. This caused delays in alert visibility.

With v2.11:

- **Network disconnection events are now generated server-side**

- Alerts appear immediately when a reader loses connectivity

- Admins can respond more quickly to wiring issues, outages, or unexpected device behavior

This ensures consistent, real-time awareness, even when devices go offline.
