## Selecting User Type {#selecting-user-type}

Since BioStar Air version 2.6, users can be categorized as:

* **Regular Users**: Can receive any supported credential type, including mobile cards, QR codes, RFID cards, facial authentication, and PINs.

* **Temporary Users**: Can only receive **Web Card** credentials, which include Dynamic QR codes and LinkPass.

Regular users can be automatically assigned full access levels, whereas temporary users require manual access level selection.


## Assigning Credentials {#assigning-credentials}

Under **Credential Details**, administrators can decide which types of credentials to assign to the user. Each credential type includes a toggle switch to enable or disable it.

### Credential Types

* **Mobile Card**: Suprema Pass mobile credential. Admins can edit the Card ID number.

* **RF Card**: Add up to 8 RFID cards per user. Configure card type (CSN / Wiegand), Card ID number, and Card Name to simplify managing multiple cards. You can also scan a physical RFID card using a connected reader by clicking **Scan with Reader** and selecting the reader.

* **Web Card**: LinkPass or Dynamic QR. (Note: Dynamic QR only appears if QR is enabled under Site Settings.)

* **Face**: Add up to two face profile images. Options include uploading an existing image, enrolling via a reader, or sending a link via email for self-enrollment using a phone's selfie camera.

* **PIN**: Set a 4–16 digit PIN for use as part of two-factor authentication (2FA).

## Setting Access Levels and Validity {#setting-access-levels-and-validity}

After selecting a credential, configure the user’s access permissions:

1. Choose an **Access Level** (full access or a predefined level).

1. Select the **Floor Levels** assigned to the user.
