BioStar Air (formerly Airfob Space) uses an edge architecture that connects readers directly to the cloud, so it does not require on-premise servers, virtual machines (VMs), VPNs, or door controllers. Because no IT maintenance is required, install a **Smart Reader** and connect it to the cloud to start access control. Readers operate across multiple sites without sharing the same network or physical location.
