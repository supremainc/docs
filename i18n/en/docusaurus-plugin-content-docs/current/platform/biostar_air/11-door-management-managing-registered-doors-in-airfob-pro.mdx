## Feature Overview {#feature-overview}

Door management in BioStar Air allows administrators to organize access points by assigning entry and exit devices, configuring relays, and setting up schedules. Doors provide structure for managing access and tracking user movements for security, fire muster, and time & attendance (T&A) purposes.

## Key Issues and Considerations {#key-issues-and-considerations}

### Using Entry and Exit Devices {#using-entry-and-exit-devices}

* It is recommended to use the relay on the **exit device** since this relay will be inside the secure perimeter.

* Entry and exit devices must have **separate network connections**. They cannot be linked via Wiegand or RS-485 in a master-slave arrangement.

### Device Assignment Rules {#device-assignment-rules}

* Each device can only be assigned to **one door**.

* If a device is already registered but does not appear in the list of available devices, check whether it is assigned to another door. If so, remove it from that door before reassigning.

## Managing Doors in the BioStar Air App {#managing-doors-in-the-airfob-pro-app}

1. Open the **BioStar Air** app.

1. Go to **All Menu** → **Access Points** → **Doors**.
