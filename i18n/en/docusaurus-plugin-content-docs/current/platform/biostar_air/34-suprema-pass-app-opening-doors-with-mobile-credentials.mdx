## Feature Overview {#feature-overview}

The Suprema Pass app provides a convenient way to open doors using mobile credentials instead of plastic RFID cards. Users can authenticate using Bluetooth or NFC by tagging their smartphone near an access control device or by using a long-press method.

## Methods to Open Doors {#methods-to-open-doors}

### Tagging Your Smartphone to the Airfob Device {#tagging-your-smartphone-to-the-airfob-device}

This method enables direct authentication via Bluetooth or NFC by bringing the smartphone close to the access control reader.

* **Bluetooth Mode**: The phone communicates wirelessly with the Airfob device.

* **NFC Mode**: Available only on Android devices, allowing authentication by touching the phone to the reader.

### Long-Press Your Mobile Card {#long-press-your-mobile-card}

Users can open doors from a short distance by holding their finger on the mobile card within the app for a few seconds while near the Airfob device.


## Tagging to the Device {#tagging-to-the-device}

The Suprema Pass (or Airfob Space) app must be running to use mobile credentials. Users can choose between two operation modes:

* **Foreground Mode**: Doors open only if the app is on-screen and the mobile card is visible.

* **Background Mode**: Doors open even when the phone is locked, as long as the app is running in the background.

Regardless of the mode, users can always authenticate by tagging their phone to the device.

### Authentication Contact Points {#authentication-contact-points}

The smartphone's NFC or Bluetooth antenna location may vary by model. Refer to your device specifications for the best contact point.


## Using the Long-Press Method {#using-the-long-press-method}

To open a door with the long-press method:

1. Ensure the app screen is turned on.

1. Hold your finger on the mobile card while near the access control reader.

1. The door will unlock, allowing you to walk through.

### Considerations for Long-Press Mode {#considerations-for-long-press-mode}

* **Bluetooth must be set to Background Mode**. This can be adjusted in the Connection Method menu.

* **Site administrators may disable this feature** for security reasons.

* The **effective range varies** depending on smartphone Bluetooth strength.

* Nearby access control readers may cause unintended authentication.
