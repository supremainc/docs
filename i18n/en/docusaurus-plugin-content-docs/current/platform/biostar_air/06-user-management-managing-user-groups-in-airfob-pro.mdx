## Feature Overview {#feature-overview}

User groups in BioStar Air allow administrators to categorize users based on departments, roles, or other classifications. This helps in organizing and managing access control more efficiently.

## Navigating to User Groups {#navigating-to-user-groups}

To manage user groups:

1. Go to **User Management** in the BioStar Air Portal.

1. Click on **User Groups** to view existing groups.

1. Here, you can **add**, **edit**, or **delete** user groups.


## Creating a User Group {#creating-a-user-group}

To create a new user group:

1. Click on **Add User Group**.

1. Enter a name for the group (e.g., "Law Team").

1. Click **OK** to create the group.


## Assigning Users to a Group {#assigning-users-to-a-group}

Once a user group is created, users can be added by:

1. Going to **Users** under **User Management**.

1. Selecting the users to be assigned.

1. Clicking on **Manage Group**.

1. Choosing the user group and confirming by clicking **OK**.

Returning to the **User Groups** interface will reflect the updated total number of users in each group.


## Creating Subgroups {#creating-subgroups}

Subgroups allow further categorization within a user group. However, subgroups are **not hierarchical**, meaning users in a subgroup are not automatically included in the parent group.

### To create a subgroup: {#to-create-a-subgroup:}

1. Select the parent group.

1. Click **Add Subgroup** and enter a name (e.g., "Civil Law Team").

1. Click **OK** to create the subgroup.

### Assigning Users to a Subgroup: {#assigning-users-to-a-subgroup:}

1. Go to **Users** under **User Management**.

1. Select the users to be added.

1. Click **Manage Group**.

1. Select the subgroup under its parent group and click **OK**.


## Understanding User Group Totals {#understanding-user-group-totals}

Since user groups are not hierarchical:

* Users in a subgroup do **not** automatically appear in the parent group.

* The total user count for a parent group does not include subgroup members unless manually added.

* Selecting a subgroup will only display users assigned specifically to that subgroup.


## Can a user belong to multiple user groups? {#can-a-user-belong-to-multiple-user-groups}

**Yes**. Users in BioStar Air can be members of **multiple user groups**.

In BioStar 2, user groups were typically tied to a single department. BioStar Air decouples this, allowing more dynamic usage:

* Filter the user list by group (e.g., "HR Department") to quickly manage access levels.

* Create context-specific groups (e.g., "Men's Locker Room") that cut across departments.

* Use user groups in **event log filters** and **report generation**.

* Assign user groups to **muster point** devices or device groups for targeted safety protocols.

This flexibility makes it easier to manage overlapping user roles and access scenarios.
