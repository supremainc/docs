## Feature Overview {#feature-overview}

Door schedules in BioStar Air allow administrators to automate door locking and unlocking based on time settings. These schedules ensure secure and controlled access throughout the day. Administrators can configure lock schedules, unlock schedules, and advanced options like "Unlock after First Authentication."

## Navigating to Door Schedules {#navigating-to-door-schedules}

To access door schedules:

1. Go to **Door Management** â†’ **Registered Doors**.

1. Select the doors you want to configure by clicking the checkbox next to each.

1. Click the **Schedule Icon** (calendar with a checkmark) in the toolbar.


## Configuring Unlock Schedules {#configuring-unlock-schedules}

Unlock schedules determine when doors remain open without authentication.

1. In the **Unlock Schedule** tab, select a predefined schedule or create a new one.

1. To create a new schedule:

   * Click **Create Schedule**.

   * Enter a **Name** and optional description.

   * Select the days and times when the door should remain unlocked.

   * Click **Save**.

1. Click **Apply** to confirm the unlock schedule.

### Unlock After First Authentication {#unlock-after-first-authentication}

This setting keeps the door locked until the first authorized user authenticates. Once unlocked, the door remains open for the rest of the scheduled period.

1. In the **Unlock Schedule** tab, enable **Unlock After First Authentication**.

1. Select a schedule defining when the door should remain open after authentication.

1. Click **Save** to apply the changes.

**Use Case**

This feature is ideal for offices and retail stores where the door should remain locked until the first employee arrives.

## Configuring Lock Schedules {#configuring-lock-schedules}

Lock schedules determine when doors remain locked, preventing access even with valid credentials.

1. In the **Lock Schedule** tab, select an existing schedule or create a new one.

1. To create a new schedule:

   * Click **Create Schedule**.

   * Enter a **Name** and optional description.

   * Select the days and times when the door should remain locked.

   * Click **Save**.

1. Click **Apply** to confirm the lock schedule.

:::note

Lock schedules override standard access rights, meaning users cannot unlock the door during the locked period.

## Creating Schedules Directly from Door Management {#creating-schedules-directly-from-door-management}

If no appropriate schedule exists, administrators can create one directly from the door schedule interface:

1. Click **Create Schedule** in the schedule selection menu.

1. Enter a schedule **Name** and description.

1. Select operating days and times.

1. Click **Save** to add the new schedule.

The new schedule will now be available for selection.


## Key Considerations {#key-considerations}

* Schedules apply only to doors with an active **internet connection**.

* Holiday groups override unlock schedules unless configured otherwise.

* For emergency access, always have at least one admin with unrestricted door access.
