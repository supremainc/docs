## Overview {#overview}

The BioStar Air portal and mobile app let administrators manage, update, and configure compatible Suprema readers.

<YouTube videoId="lpMPkMyjr-c" />

Some functions — such as **remote access**, **biometric authentication**, **QR code access**, and **firmware updates** — require an active internet connection.

:::caution

**Important**: Starting with BioStar Air 2.10 (and the BioStation 3), many new device configuration features were added. Not all devices support every feature, so menu options may vary depending on your hardware.

:::

## Registering & Deleting Devices

Registering and deleting **must** be done from the **BioStar Air smartphone app** (iOS or Android) — not from the web portal. Doing this on the web can cause operational errors.

import CustomerNote from '../../common/_biostarair-customer-notice.mdx';

<CustomerNote />

## Device Connection Status {#device-connection-status}

In the **Device List**, the status icon tells you the device’s connectivity:

* <StatusOK/> **Green Dot**: Online via Ethernet

* <StatusFail/> **Red Dot**: Offline

* <StatusUpdating/> **Orange Dot**: Firmware update in progress

* ⚪ **No Dot**: Device without a network connection (e.g., Airfob Patch)

* ⚠️ **Caution Icon**: Biometric device needs to sync with the server

**Green Dot** devices can be controlled remotely, accept QR authentication, and be updated.


## Viewing Device Info {#viewing-device-information}

Columns in the **Device List** include:

* **Product Type**: Auto-detected from Suprema's database

* **Device Nickname**: Custom label for easy recognition

* **Device ID**: Unique identifier for that device

* **Device Group**: Which group(s) it belongs to

* **Battery Status**: Only for battery-powered devices

* **Firmware Version**: Current firmware build

* **Time Zone**: Set individually per device


## Bulk Device Actions {#bulk-device-actions}

From the **Device List** toolbar, you can:

* **Refresh**: Update the device list & status

* **Delete**: Remove devices (always do in the app)

* **Manage Device Groups**: Assign devices to groups

* **Byte Order**: Switch between MSB / LSB

* **Sync with Server**: Sync biometric templates from device to server

* **Load Device Settings**: Import settings from devices originally set up in standalone mode


## Editing an Individual Device {#editing-individual-device}

1. Select the device.

1. Edit fields like **Nickname**, **Time Zone**, or **DST**.

1. Click **Save**.


## Configuring Device Features

### Device Details

Shows basic info: **model**, **serial number**, and **firmware version**.

**Actions**:

* Firmware update

* Reboot device

* Factory reset

**Settings**:

* **Nickname**: How it appears in lists/logs

* **Time Zone & DST**: Keeps logs consistent when site and device clocks differ

* **Hands‑Free Mode**: Extends BLE range

* **QR Reader**: Tells the device an RS‑485 QR reader is connected (**disables SIO2**)

* **Beep Setting**: Controls the success chime (not on all devices)

### Card Settings

:::caution

On XPass 2 and X-Station 2, card settings appear under **Details** and support is limited. A firmware update later in 2025 will improve this.

:::

#### NFC / RF Card

* **Toggle** card authentication on/off

* **Supported types**: MIFARE, DESFire, Felica, EM4100 (BioStation 3 & BioEntry W3; more devices by end of 2025), iCLASS, SEOS, HID Prox (device‑dependent)

* **Byte Order**: MSB or LSB

* **Data Reading Method**: CSN (default) or Wiegand format

  BioStar Air includes 5 built‑in formats; add more under **Settings** → **Card Format**

#### Proprietary Cards

Enable for iCLASS SE/SEOS and HID Prox (device‑dependent)

### Network

Default: **DHCP**.

Manual configuration allows:

* Static IP

* Gateway

* DNS

* Subnet mask

:::note

WLAN settings may appear, but they are not enabled at this time.

:::

### Authentication

* **Authentication Mode**: Single or multi‑factor (Face, RFID, ID, PIN)

* **Display User Name / ID**: Full, Initial, Hidden (screen devices only)

* **Authorization Timeout**: Time before returning to default screen (biometric devices only)

:::note

Appears only on devices with PIN, Face, or Fingerprint support.

:::

### Face Authentication

* Fake detection: Normal → Most Secure

* Duplicate enrollment check (on‑device only)

* Motion sensitivity (wake threshold)

* Head pose angle (degrees off‑center allowed)

* Wide search (allow partially visible faces)

* Detection distance (cm)

* Enrollment time (how long enrollment mode stays active)

:::note

Biometric devices only.

:::

#### Mask Detection

* **Level**: Strict → Most Strict

* **If Fails**: Deny or allow with logging

* **Sequence**: After Access / Before Access / Without Access

:::note

"Before" vs "After" mainly matters when using non‑face credentials.

:::

### Time & Attendance (T&A)

When enabled, **T&A events** are recorded in **Event Logs** and used in the **Hours on Site** report.

* **Disabled**: No T&A

* **User Selects**: On‑screen T&A keys (screen devices only)

* **By Schedule**: Codes vary by time of day

* **Last Choice**: Defaults to last used code

* **Fixed**: Always uses one code

* **Mobile**: Code selected in Suprema Pass app when presenting mobile credential

### Display & Sound

:::note

Full menu only on biometric station devices. On other devices, basic options (like Beep Settings) may be found elsewhere.

:::

#### Display

* **Screensaver**: Moving clock

* **Backlight**: Always on or dim after inactivity

* **Language**: Select language

* **Home Screen Logo/Notice**: Up to 10 images or a text notice

   :::note

   **Important**: After clicking **+ Update** and saving, the images/notice will no longer appear in the edit screen — but will still display on the device.

   :::

#### Sound

* **Voice Instruction**: Speaks "Access Granted" instead of beeps (select devices only)

* **Device Volume**: Adjusts the overall volume

* **Intercom Speaker/Mic Volume**: BioStation 3 only

### Wiegand Output

For integration with external systems (e.g., alarm panels).

* Output Mode: Normal / Bypass

* Fail codes

* Output info

* Pulse settings

* Mobile consecutive tag (requires Suprema Pass v2.9.0+)

* Consecutive tag limit

### Intercom (BioStation 3)

* SIP transport

* SIP address / port / registration duration

* Username / password / auth ID

* Outbound proxy

* Extensions

* Video resolution

* DTMF door opening

### Secure Tamper

Deletes **all users**, **logs**, and **encryption keys** if triggered.

### RTSP Streaming (BioStation 3)

* Address

* Port

* Credentials

* Resolution

### Bluetooth Sensitivity

RSSI adjustment determines how close you must be for automatic door unlock.

* **Decrease**: Avoid unintended activations

* **Increase**: Improve detection where interference is high
