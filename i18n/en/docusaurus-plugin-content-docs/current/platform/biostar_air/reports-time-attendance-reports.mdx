The time and attendance (T&A) report in BioStar Air is a simple **on-site work hour** report. It shows employees' start and end times based on event logs.

This feature is designed for basic reporting without complex configuration options. Time and attendance systems can have various requirements depending on local regulations. If the built-in time and attendance report does not meet your organization's needs, use a third-party T&A solution. Export event logs to **CSV** or integrate directly with third-party T&A software by using the BioStar Air API.

:::info

* The built-in time and attendance report is intentionally simple and may not meet all compliance requirements.

* If complex T&A rules exist (for example, local labor laws or shift patterns), use a third-party T&A solution.

* Export event logs to CSV for manual processing or use the API to integrate automatically with other systems.
