## Feature Overview

The Time & Attendance (T&A) report in BioStar Air is a simple **Hours on Site** report. It displays the start and end times for employees based on event logs.

This feature is designed for basic reporting without complex configuration options. Time and attendance systems often have varying requirements depending on local regulations. If the built-in T&A report does not meet your organization’s needs, we recommend using a third-party T&A solution. Event logs can be **exported as CSV** or integrated directly with third-party T&A software using the BioStar Air API.


## Navigating to the Feature

Go to: **Settings** → **Site** → **T&A Report** → **Settings**

## Common Issues & Considerations

* The built-in T&A report is intentionally simple and may not fulfill all compliance requirements.

* For complex attendance rules (e.g., regional labor laws, shift patterns), use a third-party T&A solution.

* Export event logs as CSV for manual processing, or use the API for automated integration with other systems.
