import CustomerNote from '../../common/_biostarair-customer-notice.mdx';

From BioStar Air version 2.6, two user types were introduced to enhance user management.

* <Cmd sid="user_regular_card_type" product="air" />: A user who is a regular member of an organization or facility and requires long-term, ongoing access. All credential types can be issued.

* <Cmd sid="user_temporary_card_type" product="air" />: A visitor or non-regular member who needs short-term, limited access. This can include guests, external visitors, short-term contractors, delivery couriers, and so on. Only <Cmd sid="user_form_input20" product="air" /> credentials, including QR code and LinkPass, can be issued.

## Regular user card types {#regular-user-card-typs}

The credentials you can issue to regular users are as follows.

:::info

For instructions on using mobile credentials with the Suprema Pass app, refer to [the following](suprema-pass-app-overview).

:::

### <Cmd sid="card_type_mobile" product="air" className="normal" /> {#mobileCard}

* A unique card ID is assigned automatically; set it manually if required.

* When using an **Airfob Tag** or **Airfob Patch**, integrate with an existing access control system by using the mobile card number as the card serial number.

* For compatibility with a previous system, the mobile card ID can match the RF card number of the former site.

### <Cmd sid="card_type_rf" product="air" className="normal" /> {#rfCard}

* Add up to eight RFID cards per user.

* Configure <Cmd sid="rf_card_type" product="air" />(CSN or Wiegand), <Cmd sid="wiegand_card_id" product="air" />, and <Cmd sid="rf_card_name" product="air" /> to simplify management when multiple cards are assigned.

* Select a reader in <Cmd sid="newest_rf_card_text_device" product="air" /> to scan an existing RFID card with a connected Suprema device.

* If an existing RF card has a **CSN** (card serial number), enter the CSN manually.

### <Cmd sid="card_type_option3" product="air" className="normal" /> {#qrCode}

* Regular users can use the **QR code** of a mobile card.

* Access the QR code by tapping the button on the mobile card interface.

### <Cmd sid="card_type_option4" product="air" className="normal" /> {#linkPass}

* Send a web link to the user's email address or phone number.

* The user opens the received link in a web browser and clicks <Cmd sid="web_card_preview_button1" product="air" /> to gain access.

:::info

For more information on LinkPass credentials, refer to [the following](linkpass-credentials).

:::

### Facial authentication {#face}

* Add up to two face profile images per user.

* Register through a connected reader or by uploading an image.

* Send an email link to the user, then capture a photo with a mobile device camera to register.

### PIN {#pin}

Set a 4–16-digit PIN to use as part of two-factor authentication (2FA).

## Temporary user card types {#temporary-user-card-typs}

Temporary users do not receive mobile or RFID cards. Instead, issue **web-based credentials** that do not require an app download. Available options are as follows:

### <Cmd sid="card_type_option3" product="air" className="normal" /> {#TempQrCode}

* Send via email or text message.

* Accessible through a web browser.

* Use a **dynamic QR code**, which updates every five minutes, to enhance security.

### <Cmd sid="card_type_option4" product="air" className="normal" /> {#TempLinkPass}

Send a web link to the user via email or text message. The user gains access by clicking <Cmd sid="web_card_preview_button1" product="air" /> in a web browser.

For more information on LinkPass credentials, refer to [the following](linkpass-credentials).

:::

## Managing access levels {#managing-access-levels}

Set **access levels** to control where credentials are allowed, regardless of whether the user is regular or temporary.

:::caution

If the user is temporary, assign restrictive access levels carefully and avoid issuing credentials with unlimited access.
