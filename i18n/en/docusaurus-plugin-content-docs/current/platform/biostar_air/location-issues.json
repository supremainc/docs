    "question": "Why Am I Being Asked to Enable Location Services?",
    "answer": "The Suprema Pass app communicates with access control devices using Bluetooth. On Android devices, enabling location services is required by the operating system for Bluetooth functionality. On iOS, location permissions are necessary for using the app in background mode."

    "question": "Does the Airfob App Store My Location Data?",
    "answer": "<b>No</b>. The Suprema Pass app does not track or store GPS-based location data, nor does it share this data with third parties.While the app uses Bluetooth location services for authentication, access logs are only recorded in the site administrator portal. The Suprema Pass app, Suprema, and MOCA System do not store or use any personal location data."

  {
    "question": "Will Enabling Location Services Drain My Phone's Battery?",
    "answer": "<b>No</b>. Unlike other apps that use GPS, the Suprema Pass app does not rely on GPS location services, so it does not increase battery consumption."
  },
  {
    "question": "Am I Required to Enable Location Services to Use the Suprema Pass?",
    "answer": "<ul><li><b>Android users</b>: Yes, location services must be enabled due to Androidâ€™s Bluetooth policy.</li><li><b>iOS users</b>: Required only for background mode. If using the \"Only while app on screen\" mode, location permissions are not needed.</li></ul>"
  },
  {
    "question": "Location Permission Requirements by Connection Method:",
    "answer": "<ul><li><b>Only while app on screen</b>: Location permission can be set to \"Allow only while using the app.\" (Not required on iOS.)</li><li><b>Background mode (Always)</b>: Location permission must be set to \"Always allow.\"</li><li><b>NFC Mode</b>: Android users must agree to location permissions.</li></ul>"
  },
  {
    "question": "Why Does My Phone Randomly Ask Me to Agree to Location Services?",
    "answer": "<ol><li>If you select \"Don't Allow\" or \"Allow Once,\" your phone may continue prompting you to enable location services. This is controlled by iOS or Android, not by the Suprema Pass app.</li><li>For iOS users, even if \"Always Allow\" is selected, Apple may still display periodic confirmation messages as part of its security policies. Please continue to click \"Always Allow\" or mobile credentials may not work consistently. Features like Background Mode and Long Press may be disabled randomly.</li></ol>"
