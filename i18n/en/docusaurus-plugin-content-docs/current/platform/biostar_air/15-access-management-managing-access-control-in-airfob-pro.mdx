## Feature Overview {#feature-overview}

Access management in BioStar Air allows administrators to define and enforce access rules based on location, time, and user roles. This system is built around **access levels**, which combine doors, schedules, and holiday groups to control user permissions.

## Understanding Access Levels {#understanding-access-levels}

Access levels define who has access, where, and when. They are composed of:

* **Doors/Door Groups**: Where access is granted.

* **Schedules**: When access is allowed.

* **Holiday Groups**: Days when access is restricted or adjusted.

Access levels should be set up before adding users to streamline the user management process.


## Setting Up Holiday Groups {#setting-up-holiday-groups}

Holiday groups define dates when access may be restricted.

1. Go to **Access Management** → **Holiday Groups**.

1. Click **Add Holiday Group**.

1. Enter a name and configure holidays:

   * Fixed Date: Select a calendar date (e.g., January 1st for New Year's Day).

   * Recurring: Define flexible dates (e.g., third Monday in February).

   * Custom Range: Set a start and end time for multi-day holidays.

1. Click **Save** to finalize.

Holiday groups override schedules. Assign unrestricted access to users who must always have entry.
