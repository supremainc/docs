## Feature Overview {#feature-overview}

The **Sensitivity Setting** feature allows users to adjust the Bluetooth recognition sensitivity between their smartphone and the Airfob device. This customization helps ensure smoother authentication, reducing unwanted access attempts or authentication failures.

<CustomerNote />

Since different smartphone models have varying Bluetooth signal strengths, users may experience different recognition distances. Additionally, environmental factors such as walls, interference, or the placement of the Airfob device can impact Bluetooth recognition.


## How to Adjust the Sensitivity Setting {#how-to-adjust-the-sensitivity-setting}

Users can fine-tune Bluetooth authentication sensitivity based on their smartphone's Bluetooth strength and personal preference.

1. Open the **Suprema Pass** app.

1. Tap the **â‰¡** (hamburger) icon in the top-right corner of the screen.

1. From the menu, select **Sensitivity Setting**.

1. Adjust the sensitivity by moving the **green circle** on the scale:

   * **Near**: Lowers sensitivity to prevent unintended authentication (e.g., if your phone unlocks doors when on your desk).

   * **Far**: Increases sensitivity if authentication fails unless the phone is extremely close to the reader.


## Tips for iOS Users {#tips-for-ios-users}

If you use Apple Pay, you may notice that it launches when bringing your iPhone close to an Airfob device. This occurs because the NFC area of the phone is detected alongside the Airfob mobile card authentication.

**Solution**: Adjusting the sensitivity setting to **Far** allows the Airfob device to recognize the phone's Bluetooth signal earlier, reducing the need to physically touch the reader. This prevents Apple Pay from triggering while still allowing seamless door access.
