Use access levels to precisely control user access. Access levels define who can access where and when. An access level consists of the following elements.

* **Door** / **door group**: Location where access is allowed

* **Schedule**: Time when access is allowed

* **Holiday group**: Dates or periods that restrict or adjust access

Set up access levels before adding users to streamline the user management process.

import CustomerNote from '../../common/_biostarair-customer-notice.mdx';

<CustomerNote />
