Describes the supported authentication methods and authentication procedures.

## Authentication mode

Set the authentication mode. You can use face, fingerprint, PIN, card, and ID in combination as authentication modes, and you can also set the schedule for each authentication mode.

:::info

Fingerprint authentication is only available on the FSF2-ODB product.

:::

### Registering auth mode {#registering-auth-mode}

1. Press <Image src='/img/common/ico-menu.svg' ico alone /> and authenticate with the Admin level credential.

2. Press <Cmd sid='ui_256' product='dev' /> → <Cmd sid='ui_261' product='dev' /> → <Image src='/img/common/ico-add2.svg' ico alone />.

3. Select <Image src='/img/common/ico-add1.svg' ico alone /> and choose the authentication method you want to use. To set an additional authentication method, select it in the same way and combine it.

4. Set <Cmd sid='ui_203' product='dev' />.

   :::info

   * You can combine selected authentication methods to authenticate all in order or choose to authenticate only some of the selected methods. For example, when combined as <Image src='/img/common/ico-authmode-card.png' ico alone /> + <Image src='/img/common/ico-authmode-face-bs3.png' ico alone /> + <Image src='/img/common/ico-authmode-pin-bs3.png' ico alone />, you must authenticate the card, face, and PIN; when combined as <Image src='/img/common/ico-authmode-card.png' ico alone /> + <Image src='/img/common/ico-authmode-face-bs3.png' ico alone /> / <Image src='/img/common/ico-authmode-pin-bs3.png' ico alone />, you must authenticate the card and then enter the face or PIN.

   * <Cmd sid='ui_203' product='dev' /> can be set in BioStar X. If there is no schedule set, only <Cmd sid='ui_163' product='dev' /> and <Cmd sid='ui_361' product='dev' /> can be selected.

   * For more information about <Cmd sid='ui_203' product='dev' /> settings, refer to the [BioStar X Administrator Guide](../../platform/biostar_x/settings-schedule).

   :::

5. To save the settings, press <Cmd sid='ui_037' product='dev' />.

### Modifying auth mode

1. Press <Image src='/img/common/ico-menu.svg' ico alone /> and authenticate with the Admin level credential.

2. Press <Cmd sid='ui_256' product='dev' /> → <Cmd sid='ui_261' product='dev' />.

3. Select the authentication mode to modify.

4. Modify the authentication mode by referring to [Registering auth mode](#registering-auth-mode) and press <Cmd sid='ui_037' product='dev' />.
