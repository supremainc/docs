## Fixing the Bracket and the Product

1. Determine the correct position to install the bracket using the provided drilling template.

  <Image src='/img/device/installation-recommended-bs3.svg' className='none' alone />

  :::info

  * The optimal height for installing device is 136 cm.

  * Install the device where it does not reach the direct sunlight or UV light.

  * Adjust the installation position so that the face is not exposed to direct sunlight when a user tries to authenticate.

  :::

2. Fix the bracket firmly using fixing screws through the bracket to the position where the device will be installed.

  :::info

  * If installing the device on a concrete wall, drill holes, insert PVC anchors, and fix them with fixing screws.

  * To avoid RF interference, a minimum separation distance must be maintained.

## Power Supply Connection

<Image src='/img/device/installation-power-connection-bs3.png' className='none' />

:::caution

* Use the IEC/EN 62368-1 approved power adapter that supports higher power consumption than the product. If you wish to connect and use another device to the power supply adapter, you should use an adapter with a current capacity which is the same or larger than the total power consumption required for the terminal and another device.

  * Refer to the [Power](product-specifications#specs.power) in the product specifications for maximum current consumption specifications.

* Use a separate power supply for Secure I/O 2, the electric lock, and the product respectively. If connecting and using the power supply to these devices together, the devices may malfunction.

* When connecting the power supply, be aware of the distance between the device and the power supply. The device should be connected as close as possible to the power supply so that the length of the connecting cable is kept to a minimum. If cable connections are made improperly it may cause the device to malfunction. It is recommended to use a 16 AWG or 18 AWG cable if the device is far from the power supply. The connection distance may differ depending on the standard of the cable used and the installation environment. The device supports both DC 24 V and DC 12 V power, so check the maximum length according to the cable specification to ensure that the unit is properly powered.

* DO NOT extend the length of power cable when using the power adapter.

* DO NOT use the CAT5 UTP 2-Wire for power supply purpose.

## Network Connection

### TCP/IP

#### LAN connection (connecting to a hub)

You can connect the product to a hub using a general type CAT-5 cable.

<Image src='/img/device/installation-network-hub-connection-bs3.png' className='none' />

#### LAN connection (connecting to a PC directly)

The device has an automatic MDI/MDIX function so that it can be connected to a PC directly using a normal straight type CAT-5 cable or a cross cable.

<Image src='/img/device/installation-network-direct-connection-bs3.png' className='none' />

:::info

When you use a gigabit network switch, see below information.

* Use a Cat5e UTP(Unshielded Twisted Pair) cable.

* Use all 4 pairs (8 lines) of cable for network connection.

* DO NOT use the pair of cable for other purpose.

## Input Connection

## Relay Connection

### Fail Safe Lock

In order to use the Fail Secure Lock, connect N/O relay as shown in the figure below There is normally no current flowing through the relay for the Fail Secure Lock. When the current flow is activated by the relay, the door will open. If the power supply to the product is cut off due to a power failure or an external factor, the door will lock.

<Image src='/img/device/installation-relay-fail-safe-lock-bs3.png' className='none' />

:::caution

* Install a diode at both sides of the door lock wire as shown in the figure to protect the relay from the reverse current, which occurs when the door lock operates.

* Use a separate power supply for the device and the door lock.

* Suprema’s standalone intelligent readers contain internal relays that can directly lock/unlock doors without external controllers for added convenience. For access control applications in need of security, however, it is NOT recommended to use the internal relay of a reader to prevent any tampering attacks which can potentially trigger the door unlock. For such applications, it is highly recommended to use a separate relay unit for a lock control such as Suprema’s Secure I/O 2, DM-20 or CoreStation installed at a secure side of a door.

:::

:::info

Take caution of the installation direction of the diode. Install the diode close to the door lock.

### Fail Secure Lock

In order to use the Fail Safe Lock, connect N/C relay as shown in the figure below. There is normally a current flowing through the relay for the Fail Safe Lock. When the relay is activated, blocking the current flow, the door will open. If the power supply to the product is cut off due to a power failure or an external factor, the door will open.

### Automatic door connection

## Connecting as a Standalone

The device can be connected to the door lock, door button, and door sensor directly without connecting a separate I/O device.

:::info

* The device can be used as a multi-door controller with the slave devices with the RS-485 cable. The slave devices are used as dummy readers and authentication is performed in the master device.

* If a fingerprint authentication device is configured as a slave device in BioStation 3, you cannot add another BioStation 3 as a slave device.

* If the fingerprint authentication device is the master device, BioStation 3 cannot be added as a slave device.

* If FaceStation F2 is a master device, BioStation 3 cannot be used as a slave device, and vice versa.

* When you connect BioStation 3 as a slave device while BioStation 3 is the master device, only one BioStation 3 can be added as a slave device.

* When BioStation 3 is the master device and another BioStation 3 is connected to it as a slave device, you can connect one additional Secure I/O 2 and DM-20 each.

* When BioStation 3 is the master device and another BioStation 3 is connected to it as a slave device, you cannot connect additional OM-120.

* The maximum number of slave devices available to connect varies according to the authentication method, number of users, and number of devices. Also note that the number of slave devices affects the authentication speed.

* A master device can control 31 slave devices. The bandwidth of RS-485 allows for up to 7 fingerprint authentication devices to be connected.

## Connecting to Secure I/O 2

Secure I/O 2 is an I/O device, can be connected to the device with the RS-485 cable. Security can be maintained even if the connection between the device and Secure I/O 2 has been lost or the power supply to the device has been shut off due to external factors.

* Use an AWG24 twisted pair with a maximum length of 1.2 km for the RS-485 cable.

* If connecting with a RS-485 daisy chain, connect the termination resistor (120 Ω) to both ends of the daisy chain connection. If connected to the middle line, the signal level becomes smaller and the communication performance will deteriorate. Make sure to connect it to both ends of the daisy chain connection.
