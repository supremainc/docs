## Note for QR code usage and device license

### How to scan a QR code

You can issue a QR code to a user and use it as an authentication method. Scan the QR code properly by following the instructions on the screen to increase the recognition rate.

<Image src='/img/device/qr-scanning-bs3.svg' className='none' alone />

* Keep the distance between the device's camera and the QR code at 30~40 cm.

* Position the QR code in the center of the scan screen of the device.

* When authenticating with the QR code downloaded to your smartphone, adjust the brightness of your smartphone so that the device can read the QR code clearly.

### Notes for device license

* Using the QR Code authentication requires a separate device license. Contact the place of purchase to issue a device license.

* The device license file is an encrypted file and cannot be modified arbitrarily.

* Device licenses are issued based on device ID. If the device ID is changed in an unusual way, the warranty service for the license is not provided.
