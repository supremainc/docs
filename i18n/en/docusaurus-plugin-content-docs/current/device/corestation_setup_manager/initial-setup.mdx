* The administrator account can only be set up when accessing CoreStation Setup Manager for the first time, and only one user can be designated. Once registration is complete, the default user ID and login password used during the first access can no longer be used. Additionally, the administrator account can review and edit all settings, including factory initialization.

* Starting from CoreStation Setup Manager version 1.01, the name of the **Level 1** administrator grade has been changed to **Administrator**, and **Level 2** to **Level 3** administrator accounts are no longer supported.
