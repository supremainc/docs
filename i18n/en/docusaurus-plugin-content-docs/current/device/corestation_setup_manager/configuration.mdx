## Search and register slave device

You can easily expand the access control system's network by adding slave devices to CoreStation. CoreStation (master) and slave devices can be connected via RS-485, and additional devices such as Secure I/O can also be connected for use.

1. Click **CONFIGURE**.

2. Right-click on CoreStation in the Device List and click **Search Slave Device**. A list of slave devices connected to CoreStation will appear.
