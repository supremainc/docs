title: BioEntry R2
description: BioEntry R2 is a compact fingerprint reader designed for ACU systems. Using the latest Suprema fingerprint recognition algorithms and sensors, it can acquire high-resolution fingerprint images and utilize multi RFID card technology that can simultaneously read 125kHz and 13.56MHz frequencies, recognizing various standard cards in one device. Additionally, with its Mullion-type design, it can be perfectly installed even in narrow spaces like door frames, and can build an enhanced ACU system together with Suprema's intelligent biometric controller, CoreStation.
