Describes the supported authentication methods and authentication procedures.

## Authentication mode

Set the authentication mode. You can combine <Cmd sid='ui_312' product='dev' />, <Cmd sid='ui_040' product='dev' />, <Cmd sid='ui_322' product='dev' />, and <Cmd sid='ui_020' product='dev' /> for authentication mode, and you can also set schedules for each authentication mode.

### Fingerprint authentication mode

You can set schedules for each authentication method that uses fingerprints.

1. Press <Image src='/img/common/ico-menu1.svg' ico alone /> and authenticate with the administrator credential.

2. Select <Cmd sid='ui_256' product='dev' /> → <Cmd sid='ui_261' product='dev' /> → <Cmd sid='ui_315' product='dev' /> and then press **OK**.

3. Select the desired item and press <IcFw />/<IcBw /> to set the schedule.

   * <Image src='/img/common/ico-authmode-finger-bs2a.png' ico alone />: Mode that uses only fingerprints.

   * <Image src='/img/common/ico-authmode-finger-bs2a.png' ico alone /> + <Image src='/img/common/ico-authmode-pin-bs2a.png' ico alone />: Mode that authenticates using fingerprints followed by entering PIN.

4. Press **OK** to save the settings.

:::info

* <Cmd sid='ui_203' product='dev' /> can be set in BioStar X. If no schedule is set, only <Cmd sid='ui_361' product='dev' /> can be selected.

* For more information about <Cmd sid='ui_203' product='dev' /> settings, refer to the [BioStar X Administrator Guide](../../platform/biostar_x/settings-schedule).

## Attendance Mode

You can set how to register T&A mode.

1. Press <Image src='/img/common/ico-menu1.svg' ico alone /> and authenticate with the administrator credential.

2. Select <Cmd sid='ui_256' product='dev' /> → <Cmd sid='ui_083_title' product='dev' /> and then press **OK**.

   <Image src='/img/device/bs2a-auth.png' />

3. Select the desired item and press <IcFw />/<IcBw /> to change the settings.

## Server matching

You can set up server matching. When server matching is used, authentication is performed on BioStar X without authentication on the device. It can be used when the device has too much user information or when the device is installed outside.

1. Press <Image src='/img/common/ico-menu1.svg' ico alone /> and authenticate with the administrator credential.

2. Select <Cmd sid='ui_256' product='dev' /> → <Cmd sid='ui_190' product='dev' /> and then press **OK**.

3. Press <IcFw />/<IcBw /> to change the settings.

4. Press **OK** to save the settings.

:::info

* You can only use <Cmd sid='ui_190' product='dev' /> with <Cmd sid='ui_312' product='dev' />, <Cmd sid='ui_322' product='dev' />, and <Cmd sid='ui_020' product='dev' />.

* If using <Cmd sid='ui_190' product='dev' />, you must enable server matching on both the device and BioStar X. For more information about BioStar X server matching settings, refer to the [BioStar X Administrator Guide](../../platform/biostar_x/settings-server-server#servermatching).

## Fingerprint Settings

You can change the settings for fingerprint authentication.

1. Press <Image src='/img/common/ico-menu1.svg' ico alone /> and authenticate with the administrator credential.

2. Select <Cmd sid='ui_256' product='dev' /> → <Cmd sid='ui_314' product='dev' /> and then press **OK**.

   <Image src='/img/device/bs2a-fingerprint.png' />

3. Select the desired item and press <IcFw />/<IcBw /> to change the settings.

   * <Cmd sid='ui_149' product='dev' />: You can set the security level for 1:N authentication.

   * <Cmd sid='ui_130' product='dev' />: Set the wait time for fingerprint matching. If authentication is not completed within the set time, it fails.

   * <Cmd sid='ui_254' product='dev' />: View the raw image when scanning a fingerprint.

   * <Cmd sid='ui_197' product='dev' />: Set the fingerprint sensor sensitivity. Set the sensitivity higher to obtain precise fingerprint information.

   * <Cmd sid='ui_249' product='dev' />: Set the fake fingerprint detection level. Higher levels for fake fingerprint detection may also increase rejection rates for actual people’s fingerprints.

   * <Cmd sid='ui_003' product='dev' />: Set the fingerprint authentication performance. When you select <Cmd sid='ui_275' product='dev' />, authentication speed is set according to the total number of fingerprint templates enrolled in the device.

   * <Cmd sid='ui_342' product='dev' />: Set the fingerprint template format. The default is <Cmd sid='ui_057' product='dev' />. Changing the template format blocks the use of all previously stored fingerprints, so proceed with caution.

     :::info

     Delete all user fingerprint information and then change the template format. If user fingerprint information is enrolled, you cannot change the template format. 

     :::

   * <Cmd sid='ui_198' product='dev' />: Set to <Cmd sid='ui_277' product='dev' /> to turn on the fingerprint sensor when it detects the user’s finger. Set to <Cmd sid='ui_362' product='dev' /> to keep the sensor always on, even when not scanning fingerprints.

   * <Cmd sid='ui_116' product='dev' />: Inspect the quality of the scanned fingerprint to save high-quality fingerprint data. When enabled, the device notifies the user if the fingerprint quality is low, helping them scan correctly.

   * <Cmd sid='ui_118' product='dev' />: Check for duplicate fingerprints during enrollment.

4. Press **OK** to save the settings.
