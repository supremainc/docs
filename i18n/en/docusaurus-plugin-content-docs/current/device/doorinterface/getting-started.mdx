### Installation example

This product can easily configure up to 2 access doors as an extension module.

When integrated with BioStar X, both access control and attendance management can be utilized, providing various interfaces such as RS-485 (OSDP), Wiegand, supervised input, and AUX.

### System diagram

This product supports 3 RS-485 ports, and by daisy-chaining multiple Door Interfaces to the master device, you can configure up to 34 doors.

<Image src='/img/device/system-configuration-di24.png' width='75%' className='none' />

:::info

* Up to 2 devices can be connected per port for RS-485 0 and RS-485 1.

* If more than 3 devices are connected to a single RS-485 port, the desired device may not appear in the connectable list when searching for slave devices.

* When connecting the Door Interface as a slave to the host port of the master device, you can open access doors by identifying the facility code of the card through the Facility Code for Offline Mode, even if the connection with the master device is lost for the slave devices connected to the Door Interface.
