Suprema Device Manager is a mobile application that allows configuration of Suprema's XPass D2, XPass 2, and BioEntry W3 using BLE communication.

Administrators can connect to the server from a PC or set the device's network, server, RS-485 communication, card format, keypad settings, PIN, LED, and buzzer from a mobile device without physically disconnecting it, and can also use functions such as device restart, firmware upgrade, and device setting initialization.

For XPass D2, values set once can be saved as a template for quick and easy application to multiple devices.

:::info

Using Suprema Device Manager allows on-site modification of the settings of XPass D2 configured with third-party controllers.
