You can configure settings to apply to XPass D2 as a template and then directly apply them to individual devices. You can apply settings much faster than by accessing the management program on a PC or using command cards.

:::info

Some settings may not apply if the device's firmware version is low. To apply all settings, refer to [Upgrade device firmware](#device-firmware-upgrade) to upgrade the firmware.

:::

## Add template {#template-add}

You can set RS-485 communication, card format, keypad settings, PIN, LED, and buzzer before adding them as a template. Adding a template allows you to quickly and easily apply settings without configuring each individual device every time.

1. Run the Suprema Device Manager on your mobile device.

2. Select XPass D2 on the main screen.

3. Tap <Cmd sid='ui_338' product='dev' /> → <Image src='/img/common/ico-add.svg' ico alone />.
