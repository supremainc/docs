* Press the **INIT** button for more than 2 seconds after initializing the product linked to the device to connect it to another device.

* Press the **RESET** button to reboot the product.

* You can use the product’s power output (12V, up to 1.5A) to power the Wiegand device when connecting it to the product. If you connect three Wiegand devices that consume 200mA, you can connect devices that consume up to 900mA to the remaining power output terminals.

* The RTC battery capacity is 226mAh, and the expected lifespan may vary depending on the installation environment and usage method. When replacing the RTC battery, please adhere to CR2032.
