:::info

* Use an AWG24 twisted pair with a maximum length of 1.2 km for the RS-485 cable.

* It is recommended to use RS-485 cables with a characteristic impedance of 120 Ω.

* Connect termination resistors (120 Ω) at both ends of the RS-485 daisy chain connection. If connected to the middle line, the signal level becomes smaller and the communication performance will deteriorate. Make sure to connect it to both ends of the daisy chain connection. Set this product's termination resistor switch to ON.

* This product can connect up to 31 devices to a single master device.
