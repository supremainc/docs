## RS-485 Connection

:::info

* Use an AWG24 twisted pair with a maximum length of 1.2 km for the RS-485 cable.

* It is recommended to use RS-485 cables with a characteristic impedance of 120 Ω.

* If connecting with a RS-485 daisy chain, connect the termination resistor (120 Ω) to both ends of the daisy chain connection. If connected to the middle line, the signal level becomes smaller and the communication performance will deteriorate. Make sure to connect it to both ends of the daisy chain connection.

* You can connect up to 31 card readers with the product, and up to 7 biometric devices can be connected in combination with 24 card readers.

* If XPass or XPass 2 is connected to the master device, only card authentication can be used.
