   :::info

   * If installing the product on a concrete wall, drill a hole, insert a PVC anchor, and secure it with a fixing screw.

   * To avoid RF interference, a minimum separation distance must be maintained.

   :::info

   IMake sure that the cable cover is completely closed after connecting it to the product to maintain the water-resistant and dust-resistant features (IP65 rating).

   :::

3. Mount the product on the fixed bracket.

### Maximum extension length by cable specification

The distance that can be connected may vary depending on the cable specifications and installation environment used for power connection. If cable connections are made improperly it may cause the device to malfunction. The product supports DC 12 V, DC 24 V, and PoE. Check the maximum extension length for each cable gauge and connect the power correctly.

## Firmware upgrade

You can connect a USB memory stick to upgrade the firmware.

1. Save the firmware file to a USB memory stick for upgrade.

   :::info

   It is recommended to save only one firmware file on the USB memory stick for the upgrade.

   :::

2. Connect the USB memory stick to the device.

   :::info

   Authentication is temporarily suspended while the USB memory is being read.

   :::

3. When the LED/buzzer indicates an authentication request, authenticate with an administrator credential.

   :::info

   * Register the administrator on BioStar X for the device. You cannot proceed with the firmware upgrade if an administrator is not registered on the device. For detailed information on how to register an administrator, please refer to the [BioStar X Administrator Manual](../../platform/biostar_x/set-permission).

   * Only one authentication attempt is allowed per USB memory insertion.

   * If authentication fails, the LED/buzzer indicates the failure and USB reading ends. Disconnect the USB memory and reconnect it to the device.

   :::

4. After successful administrator authentication, the device performs a firmware upgrade and indicates the upgrade with the LED.

   :::info

   If the firmware file is missing or corrupted, the upgrade does not proceed and the LED/buzzer indicates failure.

   :::

5. The device restarts automatically after the firmware upgrade is complete.

:::caution

Do not disconnect the power supply while upgrading the firmware of the device. The device may malfunction.
