## Notes on QR/Barcode and Device License

### Correct QR/Barcode Authentication Method {#how-to-scan-qrbarcode}

You can issue a QR/barcode to the user for use as a means of authentication. Scan the QR/Barcode as instructed to improve recognition.

<Image src='/img/device/qr-scanning-xpq2.svg' className='none' width={300} alone />

* Keep a distance of 5–20 cm between the device’s scanner and the QR/Barcode.

* Position the QR/Barcode in the center of the scanner.

* If authenticating with a QR/barcode downloaded to a mobile device, adjust the brightness of the mobile device to ensure the screen is clearly visible.

* QR/Barcode scanning may take longer or fail if the position, distance, or lighting is inadequate.

### Notes for device license

* A separate device license is required to use QR/barcode authentication. Contact the place of purchase to issue a device license.

* The device license file is an encrypted file and cannot be modified arbitrarily.

* Device licenses are issued based on device ID. If the device ID is changed in an unusual way, the warranty service for the license is not provided.
