## Notes on QR/Barcode and Device License

### Correct QR/Barcode Authentication Method {#how-to-scan-qrbarcode}

You can issue a QR/barcode to the user for use as a means of authentication. Scan the QR/Barcode as instructed to improve recognition.

<Image src='/img/device/qr-scanning-xpq2.svg' className='none' width={300} alone />

* Keep a distance of 5-15 cm between the device’s scanner and the QR/Barcode.

* Position the QR/Barcode in the center of the scanner.

* If authenticating with a QR/barcode downloaded to a mobile device, adjust the brightness of the mobile device to ensure the screen is clearly visible.

* QR/Barcode scanning may take longer or fail if the position, distance, or lighting is inadequate.

### Barcode types and minimum readable size

The following are examples of the minimum barcode sizes that can be read for each barcode type.

Actual read rates may vary depending on print quality, encoding, lighting, camera resolution, shooting distance, and other conditions.

### Notes for device license

* Using additional QR/Barcode authentication methods requires a separate device license. Contact the place of purchase to issue a device license.

* The device license file is an encrypted file and cannot be modified arbitrarily.

* Device licenses are issued based on device ID. If the device ID is changed in an unusual way, the warranty service for the license is not provided.

* For more information on device licenses, refer to the [BioStar X Administrator Guide](../../platform/biostar_x/settings-license-device-license).
