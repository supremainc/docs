:::info

* Press the **INIT** button for more than 2 seconds after initializing the product linked to the device to connect it to another device.

* Press the **RESET** button to reboot the product.

* You can use the product's reader power output (12 Vdc, up to 0.6 A / 24 Vdc, up to 0.3 A) as the power for the Wiegand device when connecting the product to the Wiegand device. You can connect two Wiegand devices consuming 0.3 A based on 12 Vdc power output.

### Installation example

This product is designed for an enterprise-grade environment as a central access control system and can store information for up to 500,000 users.

When integrated with BioStar X, both access control and attendance management can be utilized, providing various interfaces such as RS-485 (OSDP), Wiegand, supervised input, and AUX.

### System diagram

This product supports three RS-485 ports, and by connecting the Door Interface in a daisy chain, up to 34 doors can be configured.

<Image src='/img/device/system-configuration-cs20.svg' width="70%" className='none' />

:::info

* Up to 2 devices can be connected per port for RS-485 0 and RS-485 1.

* If more than 3 devices are connected to a single RS-485 port, the desired device may not appear in the connectable list when searching for slave devices.

* If using a SAM card on the CS-20P model, only slave devices directly connected to the reader port of the CS-20P can be used.

* If you connect the Door Interface as a slave to the host port, even if the connection with CoreStation 20 is interrupted, the slave devices connected to the Door Interface can identify the Facility Code of the card through the offline mode dedicated Facility Code and unlock the door.
