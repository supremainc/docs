### Power-specific reader and lock power specifications

| Power          | Reader (maximum current, number of devices) | Lock (maximum current, number of devices) |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| DC 12V         | 600mA (300mA x 2)                           | 1.2A (600mA x 2)                          |
| DC 24V         | 300mA (150mA x 2)                           | 600mA (300mA x 2)                         |
| PoE+ (12V out) | 600mA (300mA x 2)                           | 600mA (600mA x 1)                         |

### Maximum extension length by cable specification

The distance that can be connected may vary depending on the cable specifications and installation environment used for power connection. If cable connections are made improperly it may cause the device to malfunction. This product supports DC 12V, DC 24V, and PoE+ power, so ensure to correctly connect power by checking the maximum extension length according to each cable specification.

## RS-485 Connection

This product supports three RS-485 ports, and by connecting the Door Interface in a daisy chain, up to 34 doors can be configured.

<Image src='/img/device/installation-rs485-connection-cs20.png' width='60%' className='none' />

:::info

* The total number of RS-485 devices connected to the product must not exceed 84. (Including Door Interface)

* Up to 2 devices can be connected per port for RS-485 0 and RS-485 1.

* If more than 3 devices are connected to a single RS-485 port, the desired device may not appear in the connectable list when searching for slave devices.

* Use AWG26 or larger for RS-485 cables, and all wiring must comply with ANSI/NFPA 70 standards.

* Use an AWG24 twisted pair with a maximum length of 1.2 km for the RS-485 cable.

* It is recommended to use RS-485 cables with a characteristic impedance of 120 Ω.

* Connect termination resistors (120 Ω) at both ends of the RS-485 daisy chain connection. If connected to the middle line, the signal level becomes smaller and the communication performance will deteriorate. Make sure to connect it to both ends of the daisy chain connection. Set the termination resistor switch ON for this product.

## SAM Card Slot (Supported only by CS-20P model)

You can use a SAM (Secure Access Module) card.

<Image src='/img/device/installation-sam-slot-connection-cs20.png' width='60%' className='none' />

:::info

If using a SAM card on the CS-20P model, only slave devices directly connected to the reader port of the CS-20P can be used.
