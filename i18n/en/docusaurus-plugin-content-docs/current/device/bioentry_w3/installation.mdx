## Firmware upgrade

You can connect a USB memory stick to upgrade the firmware.

1. Save the firmware file to a USB memory stick for upgrade.

   :::info

   It is recommended to save only one firmware file on the USB memory stick for the upgrade.

   :::

2. Connect the USB memory stick to the device.

3. If the 'Administrator authentication is required' message appears, authenticate using administrator credentials.

   :::info

   Register the administrator on BioStar X for the device. You cannot proceed with the firmware upgrade if an administrator is not registered on the device. For detailed information on how to register an administrator, please refer to the [BioStar X Administrator Manual](../../platform/biostar_x/set-permission).

   :::

4. Once the administrator authentication is successful, the firmware file will be transferred to the device.

5. When the firmware file transfer is complete, a message to remove the USB memory stick will appear on the screen. Remove the USB memory stick.

   :::info

   If you do not remove the USB memory stick, the firmware upgrade will run again after the device restarts.

   :::

6. After proceeding with the firmware upgrade, the device will restart automatically.

:::caution

Do not disconnect the power supply while upgrading the firmware of the device. The device may malfunction.
