## Network Connection

### TCP/IP

#### LAN connection (connecting to a hub)

You can connect the device to a hub using a general type CAT-5 cable.

<Image src='/img/device/installation-network-hub-connection-bew3.png' className='none' />

#### LAN connection (connecting to a PC directly)

The device has an automatic MDI/MDIX function so that it can be connected to a PC directly using a normal straight type CAT-5 cable or a cross cable.

## Relay Connection

### Fail Safe Lock

In order to use the Fail Safe Lock, connect N/C relay as shown in the figure below. There is normally a current flowing through the relay for the Fail Safe Lock. When the relay is activated, blocking the current flow, the door will open. If the power supply to the product is cut off due to a power failure or an external factor, the door will open.

<DaioDirectionInfo />

### Fail Secure Lock

In order to use the Fail Secure Lock, connect N/O relay as shown in the figure below There is normally no current flowing through the relay for the Fail Secure Lock. When the current flow is activated by the relay, the door will open. If the power supply to the product is cut off due to a power failure or an external factor, the door will lock.

## Connecting as a Standalone

The product can be connected to the door lock, door button, and door sensor directly without connecting a separate I/O device.

<ConnectionInfo />

## Connecting to Secure I/O 2

Secure I/O 2 is an I/O device, can be connected to the product with the RS-485 cable. Security can be maintained even if the connection between the product and Secure I/O 2 has been lost or the power supply to the product has been shut off due to external factors.

* Use an AWG24 twisted pair with a maximum length of 1.2 km for the RS-485 cable.

* If connecting with a RS-485 daisy chain, connect the termination resistor (120 Î©) to both ends of the daisy chain connection. If connected to the middle line, the signal level becomes smaller and the communication performance will deteriorate. Make sure to connect it to both ends of the daisy chain connection.

## Resetting Network Settings {#reset-network-settings}

1. Turn the power on.

1. Press the network reset button on the rear of device until the device restart automatically.

1. Connect the device with default values.

    * **TCP/IP address**: DHCP address assignment (If DHCP address assignment is failed, 169.254.x.x will be set.)

    * **Server mode**: Disabled

    * **RS-485**: Default, 115200 bps

1. Change the TCP/IP address or RS-485 information.

1. Turn the power off later on and then check the network setting is properly.


## Restoring the Factory Defaults {#factory-reset}

This will delete all data and root certificate on the device and reset the settings.

1. Turn the power on.

1. Press the reset button three times quickly.

1. When the green LED is blinking, press the reset button again.

:::info

If there is no root certificate on the device, you cannot restore the factory defaults.

## Upgrading Firmware

Upgrade the firmware by connecting a USB memory to the device.

1. Save the firmware upgrade file to USB memory.

    :::info

    It is recommended to save only one firmware file on the USB memory before the firmware upgrade.

    :::

1. Connect the USB memory to the device.

1. When the "Admin Auth Required" message appears, authenticate using an Admin level credential.

    :::info

    Register an administrator on the device in BioStar 2. If there is no administrator on the device, the firmware upgrade cannot proceed. For more information on administrator registration, please refer to the BioStar 2 Administrator Guide.

    :::

1. The firmware file will be transferred to the device after successful administrator authentication.

1. When the firmware file transfer is complete, a message to remove the USB memory will appear on the screen. Remove the USB memory.

    :::info

    If the USB memory is not removed, the firmware upgrade will restart after the device restarts.

    :::

1. After the firmware upgrade is complete, the device will automatically restart.

:::caution

Do not disconnect the power supply while upgrading the firmware of the device. The device may malfunction.
