## Notes on QR/Barcode and Device License

### Correct QR/Barcode Authentication Method {#how-to-scan-qrbarcode}

You can issue a QR/barcode to the user for use as a means of authentication. To improve recognition rate, scan the QR/barcode correctly according to the guidance on the screen.

<Image src="/img/device/qr-scanning-bs3m.svg" className="none" alone />

* Keep the distance between the device's camera and the QR/barcode at 8-25 cm.

* Position the QR/barcode so that it is centered in the device's scanning screen.

* If authenticating with a QR/barcode downloaded to a mobile device, adjust the brightness of the mobile device to ensure the screen is clearly visible.

* Failure to follow the instructions on the screen may result in slow recognition or failure of the QR/barcode.

### Notes for device license

* Using additional QR/Barcode authentication methods requires a separate device license. Contact the place of purchase to issue a device license.

* The device license file is an encrypted file and cannot be modified arbitrarily.

* Device licenses are issued based on device ID. If the device ID is changed in an unusual way, the warranty service for the license is not provided.
