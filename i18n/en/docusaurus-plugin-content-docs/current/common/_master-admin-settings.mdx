## Set master administrator

The <Cmd>Master Administrator</Cmd> feature enhances full administrator privileges of the device to improve device security and block unauthorized access and configuration changes. You must **enroll credentials** for the <Cmd>Master Administrator</Cmd> with a new device, and only registered master administrators can access the administrator menu to change device settings.

:::note

What is a master administrator?

* If you use the device without setting an administrator, anyone can access the administrator menu and change device settings. The master administrator feature enforces overall administrator settings to address these security vulnerabilities.

* The master administrator cannot be deleted directly and is only deleted during <Cmd>Factory Initialize</Cmd>.

:::

### Enroll master administrator on a new device

On a new device, you must register the <Cmd>Master Administrator</Cmd> from the start and access will be limited if not registered.

:::info

* Even if you assign a full administrator through BioStar 2, you must register the <Cmd>Master Administrator</Cmd> to use all features.

* New devices cannot perform firmware downgrades.

### Notices

* **When manually changing the device encryption key**

  When manually changing the device encryption key, a warning message will appear stating that the master administrator's PIN will be deleted, so check the message before proceeding with the change.

* **Limitations on face image transmission over RS-485 communication segments**

  Biometric credential images are not transmitted over RS-485 communication segments, so a substitute image will be displayed when viewing the registered master administrator's face on the slave device.
