* For more information about SMTP information, contact your system administrator.

* When using the SMTP server as an email account with two-factor authentication and change the password of the account, note the following: Once you set up two-factor authentication, the SMTP password is the same as the app password generated using two-factor authentication, not the password of the email account. 

  * When you set up two-step authentication, the SMTP password uses the app password generated by two-step authentication, not the password for the email account. 

  * At this time, if the password of the email account is changed, the app password is automatically deleted, and the SMTP password is no longer available. 

  * When changing the password for the email account, regenerate the app password and then set the SMTP password again.
