In order to improve the fingerprint authentication rate, enroll the fingerprint correctly. This product can authenticate fingerprints even if the user's fingerprint input angle and position change. If you enroll the fingerprint with attention to the following matters, the authentication rate can be improved.

### Selecting a finger for fingerprint input

<Image src='/img/device/fingerprint-selection.svg' className='none' alone />

* In preparation for the case that the fingerprint of a specific finger cannot be used, for example if the user is lifting a load with one hand or a finger gets hurt, up to 10 fingerprints for each user can be enrolled.

* In the case of a user whose fingerprint cannot be recognized well, the authentication rate can be improved by enrolling the same finger twice repeatedly.

* If a finger has a cut or the fingerprint is blurry, select another finger for the fingerprint.

* It is recommended to use the index finger or the middle finger when scanning the fingerprint. The authentication rate can be reduced if it is difficult to place another finger at the center of fingerprint sensor accurately.	

### Fingerprint enroll method

#### Cautions for fingerprint enrollment {#cautions-enrolling-fingerprint}

When a fingerprint is recognized, it is compared with the initially enrolled fingerprint, so the initial fingerprint enroll is the most important. Pay attention to the following matters when enrolling the fingerprint.

<Image src='/img/device/fingerprint-authentication.svg' className='none' alone />

* Place the finger deep enough to contact with the sensor completely.

* Place the center of the fingerprint in the center of the sensor.

* If a finger has a cut or the fingerprint is blurry, select another finger for the fingerprint.

* Scan the fingerprint correctly without moving according to the instruction on the screen.

* If you make the finger upright so that the contact area with the sensor is decreased or the angle of finger is warped, fingerprint authentication may not be performed.

#### If fingerprint authentication does not work well

This product can authenticate fingerprints regardless of seasonal changes or changes in the condition of the fingers. However, the authentication rate may vary according to the external environment or fingerprint input method. If the fingerprint authentication cannot be done smoothly, it is recommended to take the following measures.

* If the finger is smeared with water or sweat, dry off the finger and then scan the finger.

* If the finger is too dry, blow your breath on the fingertips and then scan the finger.

* If the finger has a cut, enroll the fingerprint of another finger.

* Since the initially enrolled fingerprint is often not input correctly, please re-enroll the fingerprint according to the [cautions for fingerprint enrollment](#cautions-enrolling-fingerprint).
