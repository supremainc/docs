Suprema's standalone intelligent readers contain internal relays that can directly lock/unlock doors without external controllers for added convenience. For access control applications in need of security, however, it is NOT recommended to use the internal relay of a reader to prevent any tampering attacks which can potentially trigger the door unlock. For such applications, it is highly recommended to use a separate relay unit for a lock control such as Suprema's Secure I/O 2, DM-20 or CoreStation installed at a secure side of a door.
