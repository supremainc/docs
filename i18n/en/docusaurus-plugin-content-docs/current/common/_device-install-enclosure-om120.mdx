:::caution

* Make sure to use separate power for the access control device and products.

* Use the IEC/EN 62368-1 approved power adapter that supports higher power consumption than the product. If you wish to connect and use another device to the power supply adapter, you should use an adapter with a current capacity which is the same or larger than the total power consumption required for the terminal and another device.

  * Refer to the [power](../device/outputmodule/product-specifications.mdx#specs.power) section of the product specifications for maximum current consumption specifications.

* DO NOT extend the length of power cable when using the power adapter.

* Use a backup battery that is 12 VDC specification and 7 Ah or higher. This product has been tested with the 'ES7-12' product from 'ROCKET', and it is recommended to use products equivalent to 'ES7-12'.
