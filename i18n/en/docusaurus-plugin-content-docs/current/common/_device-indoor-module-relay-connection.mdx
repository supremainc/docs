## Relay Connection

<Include product='corestation_20,doorinterface'>

The product has two types of relay ports—Alarm and Lock—each of which can be used for specific purposes.

* **Alarm**: Can be connected to devices that generate warning sounds or intrusion alerts, such as warning lights, sirens, or buzzers.

* **Lock**: Can be connected to devices for door locking and unlocking, such as electric strike locks or magnetic locks.

:::caution

When using a magnetic lock, connect the lock power directly.

### Fail Safe Lock

In order to use the Fail Safe Lock, connect the **NC** relay as shown in the figure below. There is normally a current flowing through the relay for the Fail Safe Lock. When the relay is activated, blocking the current flow, the door will open. If the power supply to the product is cut off due to a power failure or an external factor, the door will open.

Install a diode near both sides of the door lock wiring as shown in the figure to protect the relay from the reverse current that occurs when the door lock operates. Make sure to connect the Cathode (direction to the stripe) to the + part of the power while paying attention to the direction of the diode.

<Include product='corestation_40,doormodule,inputmodule,securemodule'>

Connect a diode to both ends of the power input as shown in the figure below when installing a deadbolt or a door strike. Make sure to connect the Cathode (direction to the stripe) to the + part of the power while paying attention to the direction of the diode.

<Include product='inputmodule'>

Do not connect the relay of this product in duplicate to the device connected to the relay port of the master device.

### Fail Secure Lock

In order to use the Fail Secure Lock, connect **NO** relay as shown in the figure below. There is normally no current flowing through the relay for the Fail Secure Lock. When the current flow is activated by the relay, the door will open. If the power supply to the product is cut off due to a power failure or an external factor, the door will lock.
