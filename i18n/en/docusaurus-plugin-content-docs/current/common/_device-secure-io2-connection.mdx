## Connecting to Secure I/O 2

Secure I/O 2 is an I/O device, can be connected to the product with the RS-485 cable. Security can be maintained even if the connection between the product and Secure I/O 2 has been lost or the power supply to the product has been shut off due to external factors.

* Use an AWG24 twisted pair with a maximum length of 1.2 km for the RS-485 cable.

* It is recommended to use RS-485 cables with a characteristic impedance of 120 Ω.

* If connecting with a RS-485 daisy chain, connect the termination resistor (120 Ω) to both ends of the daisy chain connection. If connected to the middle line, the signal level becomes smaller and the communication performance will deteriorate. Make sure to connect it to both ends of the daisy chain connection.
