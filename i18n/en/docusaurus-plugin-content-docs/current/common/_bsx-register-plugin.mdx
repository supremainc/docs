If you have activated <Cmd>Session Bridge</Cmd>, you can download the certificate at the bottom of the screen. The certificate is required for secure communication between **BioStar X** and the plugin. If you lose the certificate, you can download it again. At this time, the existing certificate will be invalidated.
