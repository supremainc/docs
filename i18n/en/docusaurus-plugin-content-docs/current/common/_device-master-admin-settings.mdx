## Set master administrator

The <Cmd sid='ui_128' product='dev' /> feature enhances the overall admin privileges of the device to improve device security and prevent unauthorized access and configuration changes. You must **enroll credentials** for the <Cmd>Master Administrator</Cmd> with a new device, and only registered master administrators can access the administrator menu to change device settings.

:::note

What is a master administrator?

* If you use the device without setting an administrator, anyone can access the administrator menu and change device settings. The master administrator feature enforces overall administrator settings to address these security vulnerabilities.

* The master admin cannot delete directly and will be deleted only during <Cmd sid='ui_072' product='dev' />.

:::

### Enroll master administrator on a new device

On a new device, <Cmd sid='ui_128' product='dev' /> must be registered from the beginning; if not registered, device usage will be restricted.

:::info

* When the new device is booted for the first time, the <Cmd sid='ui_128' product='dev' /> registration screen will appear. If <Cmd sid='ui_128' product='dev' /> is not registered, you cannot proceed to the next screen.

* Register <Cmd sid='ui_128' product='dev' /> to use all features, even if you connect to BioStar X and assign a device-wide administrator.

* New devices cannot perform firmware downgrades.

### Notices

* **When manually changing the device encryption key**

  When manually changing the device encryption key, a warning message will appear stating that the master administrator's PIN will be deleted, so check the message before proceeding with the change.

* **Limitations on face image transmission over RS-485 communication segments**

  Biometric credential images are not transmitted over RS-485 communication segments, so a substitute image will be displayed when viewing the registered master administrator's face on the slave device.
