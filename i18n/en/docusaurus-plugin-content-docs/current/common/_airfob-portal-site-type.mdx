You can select the card type as **Dynamic** or **Regular** depending on the site type.

* **Dynamic**: A type that deducts credits based on device and usage duration, allowing management actions such as revocation, suspension, reissuance, and expiration date designation even after the card is issued. This type is suitable for membership facilities like fitness clubs or study rooms, as well as co-working spaces.

* **Regular**: A type that deducts credits based on the number of cards issued, available permanently until the administrator removes the cards in **BioStar X**. This type is suitable for companies or groups to use as employee IDs and access cards.
