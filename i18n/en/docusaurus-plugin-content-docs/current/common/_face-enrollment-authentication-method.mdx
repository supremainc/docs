### Cautions for authenticating a face {#cautions-authenticating-face}

* Ensure that the face appears in the center of the deviceâ€™s screen. When the guideline is displayed, follow the instructions shown on the screen to authenticate the face.

* If a part of the face is covered with a hat, a mask, an eye patch, or sunglasses authentication may fail. Do not cover the face; allow the device to recognize both the eyebrows and the face.

* Authenticate at a location {props.name} away from the device.

* Make sure that both of your shoulders correctly appear on the screen. Authentication may fail if your shoulders are not at the same height. Stand still, and then authenticate your face.
