## Set master administrator

The <Cmd sid="ui_128" product="dev" /> feature enhances the overall admin privileges of the device to improve device security and prevent unauthorized access and configuration changes. Enroll a master administrator using this feature. Only the enrolled master administrator can access the administrator menu to change device setting.

:::note

What is a master administrator?

* If you use the device without setting an administrator, anyone can access the administrator menu and change device settings. The master administrator feature enforces overall administrator settings to address these security vulnerabilities.

* The master admin cannot delete directly and will be deleted only during <Cmd sid="ui_072" product="dev" />.

### Register the master admin

On the <Cmd sid="ui_128" product="dev" /> registration screen that appears at first boot, register <Cmd sid="ui_128" product="dev" />. If you do not register it, the device is restricted and you cannot move to the next screen.

### Notices

* **When manually changing the device encryption key**

  When manually changing the device encryption key, a warning message will appear stating that the master administrator's PIN will be deleted, so check the message before proceeding with the change.

* **Limitations on face image transmission over RS-485 communication segments**

  Biometric credential images are not transmitted over RS-485 communication segments, so a substitute image will be displayed when viewing the registered master administrator's face on the slave device.
