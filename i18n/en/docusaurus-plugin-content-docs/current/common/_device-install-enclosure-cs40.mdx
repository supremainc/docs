### Power and AUX input, tamper connection

To prevent power interruptions, you can connect an uninterruptible power supply (UPS), and contact outputs from power outage detectors or other devices can be connected to the AUX IN terminal.

You can also connect to the tamper to trigger an alarm or leave an event log if the housing opens due to external factors.

If you wish to connect and use another device to the power supply adapter, you should use an adapter with a current capacity which is the same or larger than the total power consumption required for the terminal and another device.

  * Refer to the product specifications [Power](../device/corestation_40/product-specifications.mdx#specs.power) for the maximum current specifications.

* DO NOT extend the length of power cable when using the power adapter.
