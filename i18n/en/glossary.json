    "name": "Magnetic stripe card",
    "description": "A card that stores data by altering the magnetism of its magnetic tape. For data transmission, the magnetic tape attached on one side of a magnetic stripe card must be read by a card terminal. Only limited types and small amounts of data can be stored on this type of card, and the data recorded on magnetic stripe cards can be altered or damaged upon contact with a magnet. In addition, because magnetic stripe cards do not provide sufficient security due to the fact that they do not use data encryption, they are increasingly being replaced by IC cards in various fields, including access control."
